Customer needed to unarchive a changeset in a batch change. Their unmerged PRs failed and archived.
This was a very foreign issue with me with a big gap in the docs. I filed an issue with the batch changes team, who acknowledged the docs gap and gave a detailed explanation in the github issue (linked above).
Customer was able to unarchive the changesets by updating their batch spec to match those repos again in the search query.
