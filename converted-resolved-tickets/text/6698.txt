Customer reported that they were seeing this error while searching for a file which they confirmed they could see in their repository: Post "http://gitserver-3.gitserver:3178/exec": dial tcp: lookup gitserver-3.gitserver on 10.3.240.10:53: no such host
Check for gitserver health and look for signs of OOM'ing or Crashloopbackoff.
The fix involved increasing gitserver memory limits as well as removing empty/archived repos
