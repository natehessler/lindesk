The customer experienced a Code Insights issue in which their set Code Insight was stuck in the following state: "This insight is still being processed."
1.  The GraphQL Backend was used to check to see if the insight had persisted to the database.
2.  worker, searcher, psql, and gitserver pods were checked for errors and restarted depending on whether or not they were in a failed or pending state.
An upgrade to Sourcegraph 3.35.1 was scheduled for the customer after consulting with SWE Coury Clark about this issue. The upgrade to Sourcegrph 3.35.1, deletion of the Code Insight, and a recreation of the Code Insight got the customer's issue resolved.
