The Customer request that repo and references be removed from sourcegraph.com
My understanding of the situation is that the repo is the one that scraped the customer's sensitive info and Sourcegraph is mirroring this repo and not the original source of the customer's sensitive info. We could delete this repo from Sourcegraph but that doesn't stop it from remaining public.
While it's unfortunate that they have some sensitive information out in the public, I don't see how Sourcegraph can prevent this at this point. I would suggest that the customer reaches out to the owner of the repo and requests them to purge the sensitive information from their repository, at which point Sourcegraph's mirror will also be updated to reflect the latest changes.
