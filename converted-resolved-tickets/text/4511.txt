-   Doc Update Link:
-   Customer noticed a large number of repositories were not syncing over the course of approximately a month on one of their two Sourcegraph instances. Additionally, repositories were not being removed after being deleted from their code host.
-   Collected logs from the customer, and found tens of thousands of SQL issues being raised per hour, in the form: "ERROR: there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification'
-   At this point, I reached out to engineering for help
-   Engineering found a missing index in the pgsql database
-   The missing index was manually added back to the database using the psql CREATE INDEX command
    ERROR: there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification
