Hey @avishai Batch Changes currently do not highlight or identify changesets that have possible merge conflicts.Your insight is right here. If the base branch has changed the change spec must be re-executed to re-generate the diff in each changeset, taking into account an updated base branch. This can be done by re-running the spec.Re-executing the batch change will cause the proposed changeset (with merge conflicts) to be removed (and closed as if it was published).Let me know if this helps, I was assuming this following the above batch change inquiries.
