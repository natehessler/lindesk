The customer was reporting that some queries were returning fewer results after an upgrade to 3.34.
Confirmation that the repository exists and is searchable. r:repo-name/engineering didn't return results but, r:repo-name/engineering/sub-repo did return results. I would expect sub-repo to be present in the results as it is a member of repo-name/engineering, but it is not present. Notably, other members are present in the search results, but sub-repo is not.
This was a bug in how we handle NULL values in the repo.stars column with pagination.
