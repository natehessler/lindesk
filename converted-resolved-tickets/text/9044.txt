The customer experienced a complete inability to search their monorepo due to corruption caused by a bad ref error. ​
​ 1. The gitserver logs were looked at. 2. The logs determined that a clone was not possible due to a "bad ref error" causing a corrupted repo.
​The bad reference object turned out to be a branch that could be removed from the repository without consequence. ​ The customer removed the branch on the call from the upstream (the code host) and then Sourcegraph was able to successfully clone the repo without any corruption.
