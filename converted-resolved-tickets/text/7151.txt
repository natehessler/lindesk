A Sourcegraph user attempts to use the Sourcegraph browser extension to integrate with their phabricator instance
Explore network traffic for phabricator via the browser dev tool Sourcegraph extension background page
Attempted to reproduce issue on our internal phabricator project. Was successfully able to browse phab with hover results
See last post for last standing in debug
Hey @evgeny just a quick update here --I was able to get test of the phabricator extension working, I've linked some images of what the hover results look like when the browser extension is working.In your instance, from the background page (dev tools) for the extension we're seeing failures around some graphQL requests for resolvePhabricatorDiff -- I believe these calls are being made by this function, which it looks like isn't parsing the repoName field correctly. In my test instance I'm not seeing any of these same calls being made to resolvePhabricatorDiff, and the repo naming conventions for github hosted repos seem to be working correctly.A few questions @jwon @evgeny -- What kind of codehost connection is configured for git.sgc.dropboc.com/server? Do you see the same sort of network requests visiting other repos or pages synched on your phabricator instance? Could I take a look at the request payload and response headers for the addPhabricatorRepo graphQL request?
Admin and user stalled out investigation
