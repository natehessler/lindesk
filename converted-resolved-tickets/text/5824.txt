Customer wanted to know if there is a pre-configured alert for batch change results (when they are completed successfully or if they fail) instead of having to just keep an eye on things manually.
I sent the customer a link to the doc explaining how to set up their own alert if they would like to try it for now but this is not yet available as a pre-configured alert. I also brought this to the attention of their CE.
