The customer deleted two insights from their dashboard. ​ 1. select:repo file:yarn.lock archived:no fork:no ​ 2. try {:\[\_\]} catch (:\[e\]) {} finally {:\[\_\]} lang:java patternType:structural archived:no fork:no ​ ​ The customer then experienced continuous searcher evictions ever 30 - 60 minutes. ​
​Unindexed searches were determined to be a dependency of Code Insights and therefore potentially related to the evictions taking place. The following query was run. ​ The primary database was queried using the following: select count(\*) from insights_query_runner_jobs where state in ('queued', 'processing', 'errored') ​
​The database entries that were returned were then updated using the following query: update insights_query_runner_jobs set state = 'terminated' ​ The customer reported no searcher evictions 72 hours post this update. ​
