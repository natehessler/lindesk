Issue with dockerhub rate limit
Checked for error message in sourcegraph repositories, doesnt seem to originate from our source code. It ended up just being a dockerhub issue.
Recommend following the instructions that were stated in the error logs:
    You have reached your pull rate limit. 
    You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limit
Warren had also [recommended](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C01JR51JR5J/p1644453336020579) checking out threads in [citrix](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/CT9P97S6L/p1618315478037900) (from user: chend, "ISSUE: Upgrading sourcegraph", 2021-04-13th), and a thread in trial-nchq (might be archived/no history available), which were, at the very least, similar looking issues. Looked mostly like just a dockerhub rate limiting issue, and recommending an increase rate-limit seems to be the solution.
