The customer would like to share code insights with some other people.
-   One of the ways to share code insight stated in this [doc](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_insights/explanations/viewing_code_insights) is to share it with an organization, which makes it visible to everyone in the organization. Your Sourcegraph admin would need to follow the instructions [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/organizations) in creating an organization. That way your code insight becomes visible to members of the org.
-   When you create an insight it will populate within the dashboard context you create it in, each dashboard will have a visibility level determined by organizations. Creating an insight on the All Insights dashboard will default to private. I would recommend a route here of navigating to a dashboard with the org visibility level you are looking to share the insight at (global or org specific) and then create the insight for that dashboard.If you are going to be making a few insights that may be related, you can create a custom dashboard, select the appropriate organization visibility, then share a link to the dashboard with whoever would be interested.
