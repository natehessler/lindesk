I'm trying to create a search context based on a query and added "experimentalFeatures.searchContextsQuery": true to my settings, but I still can't find the "Create context" button as mentioned in the docs (we're on 3.36.2 so should have this). Am I missing something? or should this be enabled by the admins first?
@roee.zolantz I think you may have to first enable search contexts first in your experimental settings. Your settings config should look something like: "experimentalFeatures": { "showSearchContext": true, "searchContextsQuery": true }, Please give this a try.
