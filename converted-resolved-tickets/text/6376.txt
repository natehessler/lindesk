Hi, How to disable the warning at the top of the webpage? For example, "Your connection is not private. We recommend configuring Sourcegraph to use HTTPS/SSL"
I've dug around and double checked with my teammates concerning this and unfortunately we currently don't have a way to disable/silence this banner as of now.  I know this wasn't the answer you were expecting and just want to add that the best way to do this in a prod environment is actually through the following doc: https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/http_https_configuration
