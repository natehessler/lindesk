-   Tried getting sourcegraph-frontend-\* logs, but they don't report any useful information
-   Tried to grab info about the users to differentiate them, but that didn't report any useful differentiating information. Query in case you curious:
    query{

-   https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/2263
-   https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/674 (customer repo)
-   https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/105 (customer repo)
-   https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/14610

The most pertintent:
