The customer requested help when upgrading from 3.29.0 to 3.31.0.
A meeting was scheduled with Delivery, Support, and the customer to guide the upgrade process. Things to note:
Capital One has a private image repository, so when upgrading they are responsible for pulling the latest image of all Sourcegraph services, tagging them, and adding them to their internal private registry in order for the upgrade to work. repo-updaterservice stayed in an unhealthy state until the gitserver service was able to successfully mount to the persistent volume in their AWS environment (this mount took a very long time nothing to do it about it really since this is an AWS speed issue).
