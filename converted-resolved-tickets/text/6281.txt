quick question, if move a repo to another organization (our graveyard) will the repo disappear from the searches?
Happy to jump in and help out with this. When a repository is renamed or archived/removed on the code host, in this case moving it to another org that's not part of your current org list, Sourcegraph essentially "soft deletes" it in the database and hence you may find traces of it when searching with some results from that repository. We have a workaround to remove the repo from search results here. If you have Site Admin privileges, please navigate to Site Admin -\> Manage Code Hosts -\> Code Host In the configuration, please add the following repo exclusion: "exclude": \[ { "name": "example.com/name_of_repo" } \], Sourcegraph will consider this repo as moved/deleted and will prevent it from being re-discovered which should achieve the desired outcome.
