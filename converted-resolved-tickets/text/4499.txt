Customer server crashing on single docker instance when attempting to upgrade to 3.33 from 3.31.2.
Customer diagnosed the issue, which was correct, and is being fixed in version 3.34 to be release next week.
Decided the best action going forward was to stay on 3.33 and add the --restart=unless-stopped flag to the docker run command so that the server can restart each time it crashes. Temporary fix while they await 3.34.
