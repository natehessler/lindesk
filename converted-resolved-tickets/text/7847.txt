Hi Team, I have created batch changes a week ago in \~30 repos. Some of them are merged and some are still open. Is there any API where I can get list  of Merge Requests created in batch so that I can send email reminder
Sourcegraph's GraphQL API documentation is available directly in the API console itself. To access the docs, click Docs on the right-hand side of the API console page. You can find the API console at any time by going to Settings and then clicking API console from the left sidebar, or by visiting it directly at https://sourcegraph.booking.com/api/console
To get a batch change under you namespace: query{ batchChange( namespace: "VXNlcjoxNQ==", name: "replace-viewer-configuration.spec.yaml" ){ name, state, changesets{ nodes{ state, id } } } }
To confirm your namespace id query{ user( username: "YOUR-USERNAME on your instance" ){ id } }
To get all open batch changes to confirm your batch change name query{ batchChanges( state: OPEN ){ totalCount, nodes { id, name, namespace{ namespaceName }, state, changesets{ nodes{ id } } } } }
