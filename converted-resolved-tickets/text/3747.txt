I inquired if the customer had Github webhooks set up, they did not. I asked for a screenshot of the github-proxy service from the Grafana dashboard. I asked the customer to try opening the Batch Changes URL in the Safari browser and the error persisted. I recreated the issue by applying 38,000+ changes in one batch change and found that memory issues occurred in both Safari and Chrome browsers but I did not experience the "auto-refresh" behavior that the customer experienced. I communicated the inability to replicate to the customer and they communicated that they have not experienced the issue since but will be on the lookout if it occurs again.
