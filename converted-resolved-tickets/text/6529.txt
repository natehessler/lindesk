Looking into our alerts. Looks like the repo-updater warning is quite persistent, although we definitely are syncing our monorepo. Why is this metric inaccurate?
Hey @jmeador that alert is actually just inaccurate -- we have an open issue of it and run into it fairly commonly. It's currently listed as a high priority bug for our relevant internal team. https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/20911
