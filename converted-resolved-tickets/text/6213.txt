What is the meaning of the diagonals?
I believe this is an insight "over all repos", in which case the diagonal lines means some series do not have data. My guess is the bottom series don't exist before \~July.This has a different meaning if the insight is not "all repos" - it means that some of the specified repositories do not exist.Our team is currently looking into it here https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/29678 to make this behavior more consistent and intuitive
