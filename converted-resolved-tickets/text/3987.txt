when I type (in chrome address bar) src and press tab - It searched sourcegraph.com and not our own sourcegraph instance (although the extension is configured to use our instance). Up until recently, this used to work fine.
I did a repro and I got the same thing you are getting. I dug further and discovered this is a bug already reported and this should be fixed soon.
As a quick workaround, until it's fixed, You can disable the extension and add in a chrome custom search engine. We have a doc that explains how to do this.
