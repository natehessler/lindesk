I got this error when trying to publish a batch change, authenticating ChangesetSource: no credential found that can authenticate to the code host is there a different set of github credentials needed? Or is that an error on the permissions for our existing credentials?
I'd like to double check with you whether you added a PAT to your batch changes section?This doc has the steps to set up one if you might have missed it.
Please note that for scopes, batch changes requite: repo read:org user:email read:discussion workflow
on GitHub.
