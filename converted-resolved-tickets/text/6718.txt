The customer got a failed migration error 1528395834
Tried to run the steps in the dirty database doc. Running the migration failed because some changes had already been applied. Running the migration with parts commented out worked. https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/v3.36.1/migrations/frontend/1528395834_squashed_migrations.up.sql
The customer commented out sections of the migration that had already been applied.

The target schema is marked as dirty and no other migration operation is seen running on this schema. The last migration operation over this schema has failed (or, at least, the migrator instance issuing that migration has died). Please contact support@sourcegraph.com for further assistance.
