hey Sourcegraph team! did you make any progress on service accounts? we need to rotate the API token we use for some instance-wide operations in CI/CD (because the original admin left the company), and we'd rather not tie things to an individual again.on the other hand, AFAIK we're only using this for LSIF upload and that will be slowly phased out in favour of server-side LSIF, so perhaps the need for a service account will not be so dire anymorelooking forward to hearing what you think!
Hey @Konrad Komorowski sounds like this may be related to a conversation you've had in the past with our team? Searching over the channel it looks like in the past you discussed the batch-changes service accounts (i.e. global batch change tokens)For src and uploads generally I don't believe theres a way around generating a token from a user account with the correct access on codehosts -- then having that Sourcegraph User account create an access token. Something along the lines of whats been shared in the screenshot here where I've created a service account user.Does it sound like I'm tracking this inquiry correctly? cc: @Ajay just in case I'm missing some context here
