The customer wanted to get a list of contributors in a specific repo but had it nested under an existing GraphQL query here. This didn't yield any results for the list of contributors as the customer expected.
Requested the customer to run this query instead, which was successful.
{ repositories(names: "github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph") { nodes { id name contributors(after: "last week") { nodes { person { name email } } } } } }
