How to hide the public community search contexts on Sourcegraph Cloud, eg. chakraui, cncf, crates.io, etc? As it might cause trouble in some cases.
From my quick finding, I figured this is a part of the sourcegraph cloud UI and may be impossible to hide or remove. An option, if you would like to customize your sourcegraph UI, you can deploy a self-hosted sourcegraph instance which gives you more flexibility.
