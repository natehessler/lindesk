As described by customer:
> Sourcegraph is telling me that some repositories are not cloned ... when I go to clone them, it tells me repository does not exist ... when I go to github the repository does exist and I have access to it ... ?
Describing some of these repositories...:
> -   repositories that are "disabled by administrator" in GitHub enterprise ... basically the repository exists however it cannot be indexed ... in this case ... the error message seems to need improving
> -   repositories that cannot be cloned but they do exist ... in these cases I cannot even click the settings button because the UI is telling me the repo does not exist

    A better, next place to look is 
No answer/No firm resolution. Customer seems to have moved on from the issue.
The suspicions at the time were:
-   the customer shared info about how some of the repos were "corrupted", apparently some sort of notion or quality that was specific to GitHub. Sourcegraph might not be detecting this "corruption". Not sure. One way to see if Sourcegraph does have observability of this "corruption" would have been to check 
None
Logs above already.
