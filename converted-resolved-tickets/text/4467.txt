Are markdown files parsed? How's pure text search going?
Great question. Sourcegraph does consider markdown as text, the only issue around this is around formatting (explains why we are getting partial results on the same query).Heuristically in search, a query involving multiple markdown files that have some slight differences(mostly due to formatting) does result in partial results due to the way the file is indexed and parsed.
This case is related to search and dives into markdown files. I had noticed that Michael's workgroup had a similar issue with markdown files and searching them to which Camden from eng hopped on to explain that at scale, indexing and storing markdown indexes are costly and not something that the team is looking at doing.
The customer and I worked on various examples on dotcom for me to be able to show them what adding characters does when searching for a keyword in markdown. Overall, case complexity would be a 2/10 with a quick turnaround time
