The customer is getting some 'signal: killed' errors when they are running their batch change. It looks like the issue is happening while batch changes try to unzip the repo.
Checked ggitserver logs for any errors with the repos but we didn't see anything. Tried adding -workspace volume to the src batch preview command but got a similar result where it only worked for some repos and then stopped and had to be restarted
The user could try running fewer tasks in parallel (at the cost of execution time). You could start with -j 1 (so it literally runs one at a time), and then slowly ramp back up from there. It would also be worth checking how much RAM the user has allocated to Docker.
