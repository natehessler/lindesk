Yesterday 06:13 am To Sourcegraph ‭
Hi ,
I was trying to use the source graph provided in the email link. I was using the continue with github option as I tried the username and password didn't work. Upon selecting the option I have been landed on "Authorize Source Branch" . And the below screen. Is that I should be allowing the access ..Am I doing it correct ?
​​Hello!
What you are seeing is the typical sign-in flow for Sourcegraph when using GitHub as an authentication provider.
What you are seeing is the result of your Sourcegraph Site Admin following these instructions:
https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/auth
https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app
"SourceBranch" is the name that your Site Admin has given to your Sourcegraph instance at sourcegraph.amd.com.
"AMD-Radeon-Driver" is the GitHub user or organization that created the GitHub app "SourceBranch".
You should authorize AMD-Radeon-Driver and you will be signed into Sourcegraph using GitHub. ​
