I am seeing a couple of alerts. Is there something I can do in the config to help prevent these, more cpu, memory.
These alerts are saying that some code intel searches took more than 20 seconds to resolve. If this is happening regularly we can check the CPU usage of the Zoekt web server to determine whether this is a resource issue.
