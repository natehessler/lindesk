This was two issues a user couldn't sign out -- and their permissions were going stale
Lots of checking the repo-updater grafana charts and attempts at issue reproduction
was able to reproducethe signing issue
The permissions issue was left hanging and the admin left -- likely this was just regular inefficient repo perms synching
Doc to be produced when time is permitting
