When trying to run a batch update preview after logging in to CLI. The customer gets an error.
Did some research to see if anyone has encountered this issue in the past. Found out this is a known [bug](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/29618). This was fixed 9 days ago and upgrading to the latest CLI version which was released 4 days ago should fix this.
This was resolved after the customer upgraded to the latest version of the cli.
