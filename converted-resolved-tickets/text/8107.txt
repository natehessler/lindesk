Hi Guys we have an internal request to have a generic user for Jenkins to have access to the search results API and make the authorization token available for pipelines to use, what do you recommend for those cases ?
It should be doable -- its just that the tokens are associated to user accounts. The only exception to this is for batch changes, which does have a global access token. I don't believe we have a non user affiliated token option. For instance here to curl the api you'll need a user access token
