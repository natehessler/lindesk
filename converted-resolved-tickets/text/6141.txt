If we start a new instance, say 3.35, can we import the data from our instance in 3.28 so that we don't have to upgrade sequentially?
Unfortunately, no. The migrations from version to version are too numerous, and will leave you with a large amount of dirty database errors that will be more trouble that it's worth.
