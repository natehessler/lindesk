The customer reported getting an error after setting up GitHub SSO.
The customer realized they didn't have the right callback URL in their GitHub OAuth app. https://sourcegraph.example.com/.auth/github/callback

Authentication failed. Try signing in again (and clearing cookies for the current site). The error was: no OpenID Connect state cookie found (possible request forgery, or more than 15m0s elapsed since you started the authentication process).
