Customer received this error:
Sourcegraph encountered an unexpected error. If reloading the page doesn't fix it, contact your site admin or Sourcegraph support. Unable to fetch repo revisions
Checked with the customer whether gc.auto 0 is enabled
Can you exec into the gitserver directory for this repo and run git prune and git fetch ? Let's take note of errors here. You can slack them over to me. We can try to fix the repo with git gc and re-running git fetch again.
Final update for the week (I hope):  git gc  again returned some invalid objects. I did another round of cleaning. Seems there's still an issue lingering; will plan for a fresh clone in the near future. For now: Have a great weekend. Thanks for your prompt support,
