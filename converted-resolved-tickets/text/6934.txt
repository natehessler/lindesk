Regular expressions help. Hard to describe their use-case, but they want to find something like..:
    SomeClass obj = a.foo();
    /// indeterminate lines and contents of code
    obj.someMethod()
Or like:
    $FD = open($FILENAME, 'r', ...)
    ...
    $FD.write(...)
Use-case not currently supported. See the reading that is across [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/795) and [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/796). Short version that I communicated to the customer:
> Try to use pure RegEx. We couldn't do this because your use-case requires lookaround, which we don't currently support. There's a conversation about it [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/31454). Try to use a hybrid of RegEx + Structural Search. Structural search falters when it encounters special characters that are required by RegEx (as mentioned in \[this table\](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/reference/structural
