The customer experienced a performance hit that made Sourcegraph search unusable when loading a large number of entities in their sidebar file tree.
The customer loaded a number of search results that when returned resulted in 2000+ items appearing in their file tree. The customer then experienced slow file tree performance
Engineering has provided a workaround where the site admin can control whether or not the file tree sidebar is open by default. This will be used until performance issues in the file tree can be addressed.
