I have added the configurations to set alerts up for Slack. It seems like I am having trouble with receiving alerts. I made a testing channel on Slack and also added the webhook.
A)  When you were setting up the Slack alerts, were you following the guide here? https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/alerting
If so, can you share what you have set in your site configuration for slack and the webhook? your site configuration (e.g. https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/configuration)
B)  Do you have the Grafana metrics enabled in your instance? For example if you go to... https://sourcegraph.example.com/-/debug/grafana/. sd
.. do you see the charts being populated with metrics?
https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/metrics
C)  What happens when you send a test alert? By going to the API console and sendingb e tested using the Sourcegraph GraphQL API. Visit your API Console (e.g. https://sourcegraph.example.com/api/console) and use the following mutation to trigger an alert:
mutation { triggerObservabilityTestAlert( level: "critical" ) { alwaysNil } }
SUMMARY:
This turned out to be a misconfig in adding the slack alert code to their Kubernetes sourcegraph-frontend.ConfigMap.yaml for site.json. Error msg:
    writing site config overrides to database: confdb.SiteCreateIfUpToDate: invalid settings JSON: [CommaExpected]

It looked to be that there should be a comma
