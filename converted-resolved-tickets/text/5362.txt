Does the order of external service config in a extsvc.json file effect how repos are synched? Can I remove excludes from my gitlab config and expect that repos produced on the gitlab code host by src serve git will not be recloned
Order of code host config in an extsvc.json config doesn't matter, but, src serve git running on a codehost that's already synching via a separate code host config isn't well defined and could cause unknown bugs
