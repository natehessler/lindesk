I'm trying to move our Sourcegraph instance to use ElastiCache Redis. I set the REDIS_STORE_ENDPOINT environment https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/kubernetes/configure
The customer attempted to connect to a Redis Cluster instance. We use a Go Redis (redigo) client that doesn't have direct support for clustered Redis. This caused issues like losing user sessions and the frontend failed readiness probes. Using non-distributed Redis worked.
