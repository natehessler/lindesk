-   Doc Update Link:
Customer is experiencing slow or completely stalled batch change resolutions
-   Ask for logs and Grafana dashboard screenshots from a variety of services [See GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/534)
-   Resolve that there is a performance issue caused by underprovisioning
-   Also, know that MeLi has not been able to enable webhooks on their instance due to internal infrastructure requirements. \[See Tech Design Doc\](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13wiXeBkjO3Z0-nqi2eDDOI3jbwk15ZpL2kY0prfGm2g/edit
-   Resolve that this combination of issues would cause widespread batch change resolution issues
-   Customer's trial is about to end, so they are happy to trust that our recommendations would resolve the issue instead of implementing them immediately
These recommendations were made to the customer, who plans to implement them in 1-2 months when they create their prodution instance
[See GitHub Issue for Grafana Dashboards](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/534)
