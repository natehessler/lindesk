The customer experienced a gap in search-based code intelligence in which references across a Go module were not found. ​ References within a Go file however were found. ​
​ 1. Click on "Find References" for a Go variable that has references outside the current file but within the Go module that it exists within. ​ 2. You will only find the references within that current file.
The issue has been fixed in the following GitHub issue and should be released in Sourcegraph 3.42.0. ​
