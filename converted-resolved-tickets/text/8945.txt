Hi, I have another question. Could you tell me, is there any offset parameter in search query syntax? I don't see it in the https://docs.sourcegraph.com/@3.40/code_search/reference/queriesreference\>. I would like to limit my search results with count:N property and in the second run I would like to get next batch of repositories. It's because when I try to make query without limit, I get the error like below: ✅ Parsing batch spec ✅ Resolving namespace ✅ Preparing container images ✅ Set workspace type ⠸ Resolving repositories ❌ Error: resolving repositories: error: 504 Gateway Timeout\
Run the spec file with on.repository as opposed to on.repositorymatchingquery.
Reduce scope of repositories.
With a reduced number of repos. I asked the customer to attempt with 15. This worked. The idea is to scope them out to avoid hitting rate limits.
