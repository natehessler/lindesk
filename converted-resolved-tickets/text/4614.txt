Customer complained that user id's in downloadable csv's did not correspond with Id's in the graphql API. This is because they are base64 encoded. Makes it almost impossible to know what statistics apply to what user.
Duplicated issue. Looked for a way to query a user by ID. Turns out you can only query users by username or email
GraphQL workaround for getting the correct data. Advised against using CSV's until it can be fixed.

users(activePeriod: THIS_MONTH, first:5) { totalCount nodes { username, id, usageStatistics { lastActiveTime, searchQueries, pageViews, codeIntelligenceActions, findReferencesActions, lastActiveCodeHostIntegrationTime } } } } \
