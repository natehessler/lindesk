Production instance has a weird timeout issue going. Grafana Dashboard not loading and timeout.
Check connection between auth proxy and sourcegraph load balancer (both curl and ping are fine)
Restarted sourcegraph frontends Restarted ingress-Nginx Jaeger does not show anything interesting Grafana does not load Reported that this happened intermittently Collected Frontend logs Suspected a networking issue since the request wasn't getting to Sourcegraph
It was discovered that it was indeed a network issue on Uber's side. 1 network route was dropped that resulted in partial traffic failure.
