The customer was wondering if we supported IAM Permissions when linking an external RDS Database to Sourcegraph
No, we do not. Quote from Crystal Augustus "I don't believe this is supported - those auth tokens expire after 15 minutes and need to be regenerated. Even if they have some outside process of regenerating the token / setting the env var in a running container, the Sourcegraph DB connection code needs to be able to use the new value, and I'm not sure it currently does."
N/A
