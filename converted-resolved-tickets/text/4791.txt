Have one question regarding codeintel-db ..i observe codeinteldb is located at two places...one with main database and one at codeintel itself. any plans to remove/drop the main one as i dont see any use case of that database ?
If their Sourcegraph instance is pointed to B for the codeintel-db then you should be able to drop the codeinteld from A. It shouldn't be used by the instance at all.
You might want to check to see if there's any data in the codeintel-db on A before dropping it, but if code intel is working correctly for them it doesn't really matter (and might be hard to rescue anyway).
