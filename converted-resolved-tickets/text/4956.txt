Customer reported a dirty database error when attempting to deploy their k8s deployment of sourcegraph.
The error was clear and did not require any additional troubleshooting.
I asked them to follow the procedure in https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/how-to/dirty_database
They did so, and this solved the issue.
