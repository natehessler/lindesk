Hey @adam.moss. Happy to keep the conversation going with @Jason Harris out today.As @Stephen.Kershaw pointed out above, typically when this type of error comes up, raising max_connections in the Postgres Config map tends to fix it.Also, raising work_mem helps sustain memory requirements that the additional maximum connections may require.Please see more here.
This is one way this problem can be fixed, but we don't know because the customer never got back to us on it.
