Add repos self hosted instance
Got it! So the steps for adding repos depends on whether you are a Site Admin or a regular user using Cloud. Since you are self hosted, only site admins can add new repos. If you go here to https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/external_service the options are "Site admins can configure the following code hosts:" Then for example, select either Github or Gitlab and follow the steps for whether you are a Site admin or User. I'll note that it appears in the UI the names have changed since this doc was written / depending on your Sourcegraph version. The docs say Site admin: Go to Site admin \> Manage repositories \> Add repositories In mine It's Site admin: Go to Site admin \> Manage code hosts \> Add code hosts Does that help to answer your question? Let me know if any of that is confusing and I can explain further
