We have the search-export plugin installed, but the CSVs it generated are very partial (getting a csv with 14 rows on a search with 500+ results). This makes it impossible to use sourcegraph to get data to be used elsewhere. Can you provide any help with this?
Understood. Fairly easy fix for this. Could you please try to add the exhaustive search filter to your query: This would be count:all Also, if it helps, we have a doc that explains this discrepancy and offers a workaround for it by using the above filter. Perhaps you can try this and see if it makes any difference towards expected outcome for you.
