Hey guys, we are using an S3 bucket for code intel and authenticating via access and secret key pair. Reading the doc I see PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_USE_EC2_ROLE_CREDENTIALS. Can we use kube2iam by defining a role authorized to access the bucket and letting the kubernetes pod assume that role via "http://iam.amazonaws.com/roleiam.amazonaws.com/role\>: my-role" kube2iam annotation?
If i remember correctly, there was a feature request to auth S3 with kube2iam . Let me just pull that up for us. Currently, I do know that we accept access token key pairs as environment variables. I believe the solution with kube2iam is to redirect traffic going into the EC2 API for container-to-container on each instance, making a call to the AWS API to retrieve credentials then return this to the caller. Sort of like a messenger, or better yet, a man in the middle type of scenario. Nonetheless, if an instance is configured for IAM, the SDK should use credentials automatically. These need not to be manually specified. :thinking_face: So in real sense, this is "possible", it's just that Sourcegraph currently requires some configuration validation to access the secret keys. Essentially, it is correct that there's a need to support IAM auth flows instead of explicitly relying on env vars. PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_USE_EC2_ROLE_CREDENTIALS=true Happy to double check and confirm on this feature request. Be back soon.
