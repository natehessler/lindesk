How do I speed up insight updates?
The customer's resources allocated to the codeinsights-db was extremely low. I recommended scaling the DB vertically. Customer was then unresponsive for a week. After checking in multiple times without a response, I'm closing this ticket. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if this fixed their issue or not, but I'm pretty sure it did.
