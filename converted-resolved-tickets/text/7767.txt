-   How can I run a search across all branches of my repo?
    https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/reference/language
    This doc is useful as a comprehensive guide, but here are two quick examples:
    Use rev search to target a specific tag or a branch:
    https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+r:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+rev:v3.39.0&patternType=regexp
    Use glob syntax to target all branches:
    https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24%40*refs/heads/*+&patternType=literal
