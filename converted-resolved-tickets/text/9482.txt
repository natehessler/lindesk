Hi, i'm trying to create some insights.  How would i do the following query:
1.  we have a .ruby-version in every repo, how would i write a query to do that. Example file contents:
3.0.3
2.  get the version of a gem used by apps from either Gemfile or Gemfile.lock. ie nokgiri version across all our apps
@adam , got a couple of options for you to try out here for; file:.ruby-version.tt content:
file:Gemfile nokogiri (
