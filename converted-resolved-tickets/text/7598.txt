A user from Upwork is having problems getting hovers to work using the bitbucket plugin. Code intel works fine on their Sourcegraph instance. In the browser console, the user is seeing 
-   I was thinking this maybe related to this [bug](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/32599) that was recently fixed.
-   I did a test on our bitbucket instance and everything works fine, tho I see it's on version 1.4.15.
-   The customer is currently on v1.3.6 and I encouraged they update to the latest version following the instructions in this doc. However, upgrading still takes them back to their previous v1.3.6.
-   the plugin currently does not work with instances on 3.37.0 and 3.38.0.
-   upgrading to 3.39.0 which includes the fix [pull/33406](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/33406) should resolve the issue
-   "corsOrigin" must be added in their instance site configuration
-   Upgrading their sourcegraph instance to v3.39.0 should resolve the issue for the customer.
