repos not syncing
Asked for logs... sourcegraph-frontend-\*, repo-updater, gitserver, the usuals.
Also suggested a manual resync:
> If you navigate to the repository's settings, and select "Mirroring", there should be a button for "Refresh now" that manually fires a sync.
... But this is only reasonable for small numbers of repositories (otherwise it becomes tedious), this solution does not scale well.
None... Customer did not respond with logs.
"Some repositories could not be synced" \
