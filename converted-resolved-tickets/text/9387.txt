Hi,\
Also for Quick links , you can add the name and url as shown in below snippet from Global settings "quicklinks": \[ { "name": "Description for your link" "url": "link url you want to embed" },
You can find more information about such Global setting parameters here.I am also attaching the screenshot as examples on how to apply these Global settings for your reference. Please let me know if you have any further queries on this or you look for something else.
