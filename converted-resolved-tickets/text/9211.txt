Looking at the above thread it seems the issue is solved but I'm still unable to view GitLab results in Sourcegraph - I tried using Private browsing but no joy. Is anyone else still having issues?

Related issue was resolved. See resolution section.
Users unable to view GitLab results need to log out of both Sourcegraph and GitLab and log in to GitLab then Sourcegraph again to revoke and approve a new access token.
