Customer wanted to know if there are ways to track API calls across their code base. Examples of what they're looking for:
    "Cresta SPA (browser)
    User sends "Create" request for todo
    API-router
    Receives create todo request and sends to backend service
    Todo service
    Handles todo request
    Returns new todo to Cresta SPA
    Cresta SPA (browser)
    Receives new todo object
    Puts it into the todo list
    So the structure is like this:
    proto repo: Has the original proto files and generated libraries
    client repo: Typescript web app that installs the generated TS client library from private npm
    server repo: Go servers that depends on the generated Go libraries.
    One possible way of tracking it is:
    From the client repo
    -> cross reference to the invocation of a method in client library
    -> cross reference to the proto that defines the method
    -> cross reference to the generated server library
    -> cross reference to the server implementation code
The closest thing that we have is probably our code intelligence features. anything more specific will likely be a feature request
