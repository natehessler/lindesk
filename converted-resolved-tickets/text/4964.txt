The customer was getting an error when they were setting up their EC2 instance. The customer rebooted the EC2 instance and the instance was starting in safe mode.
The errors showed that the instance was starting in safe mode. According to the AWS docs, this could happen for two reasons:
Auto-mount failures caused by syntax errors in the /etc/fstab file can cause the instance to enter emergency mode. Also, if the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume listed in the file is detached from the instance. AWS has docs on how to exit out of safe mode but the customer opted to start a new instance. https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-linux-emergency-mode/
