​from repo-updater I saw "t=2022-05-05T20:42:49+0000 lvl=warn msg=\"failed to execute redis command\" cmd=SETEX error=\"dial tcp: lookup redis-cache on 169.254.0.1:53: no such host\"" \]
​Do we need an env var to define the cache server?
​Based on your deployment it would seem that you have to follow the instructions here and add those environment variables to the following services:
sourcegraph-frontend repo-updater gitserver searcher symbols worker ​ ​I realize that you are not using a custom Redis server but the non-traditional deployment of your Sourcegraph instance leads me to believe adding these environment variables is the appropriate next step. Historically we have had to re-define environment variables across your instance. ​ ​
