1.) Any ideas on backing up data in EFS volume?
2.) How to upgrade while using Helm?
1.) From Kelvin:
> I don't seen any past case history that would suggest any unexpected turbulence with doing a EFS volume backup and then upgrading, in case you wanted extra confidence. So it might be as isolated of an operation as just following Amazon's guide
From Emily C.:
> To add to what Kelvin mentioned, the backups that we're most concerned about would be of the databases---we outline more info here: https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/migrate-backup (Specifically the postgres database, as it can't otherwise be restored.)
2.) Uhhh: [GitHub](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/626)
Ultimately, it ended [here](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C029VE4A12R/p1642107541024400?thread_ts=1641506269.005000&cid=C029VE4A12R), and turned into something else, [here](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C029VE4A12R/p1642097846018900), which had its own issue filed, [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/630). Also related to Helm.
