The customer was unable to access repositories with an organization scope on Sourcegraph. The customer was able to access the repositories on their Github instance, however.
The customer was asked to search for their organization's public repositories by using the search query repo:github to test their Sourcegraph permissions. The customer was able to see the organization's public repositories and it was determined at this moment that the customer was experiencing a bug documented in the already-filed Github issue.
The customer was given access to a team within the Github organization. The team scope is not experiencing any known permission syncing issues within Sourcegraph currently.
