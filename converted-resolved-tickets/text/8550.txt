Does the gitserver fully clone all repos, when I ssh into the a gitserver instnaces and ls /data/repos/\
Hey Katie! Happy to help out with this. Yes this expected. Gitserver keeps a shallow clone of a repo so you won't see the files exactly. Running ls -la in the .git directory you'll be able to see branches and other sub directories. In simpler terms, basically gitserver is like a cache of your code host.
