Customer unable to browse non-main branches on a monorepo
-   requested logs from gitserver and repo-updater: found some long executing requests
-   requested Grafana dashboards for repo-updater: found performance issues, including long running requests
-   Asked admin if they had provisioned resources according to our Monorepo scaling docs: https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/kubernetes/scale
-   They had not, so they performed the necessary re-provisioning and the problem is now resolved
Reprovisioning their k8s with better resource limits fixed the issue
