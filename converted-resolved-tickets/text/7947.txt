The customer is not receiving any results for the search testApiClientExistingUserLogin even though they know there to be results for it within their Sourcegraph instance.
1.  A Jaeger trace was done on the search
2.  The repoUpdateListInterval was updated to force quicker repo updates.
No resolution due to deployment configuration being outside of the supported path. It is most likely that the index of the repos is malfunctioning due to the zoekt shards not being adequately balanced. ​
