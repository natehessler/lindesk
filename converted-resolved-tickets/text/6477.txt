Hi! I could use some help crafting this query (currently running into a "too many files to search" error.
https://sourcegraph.netflix.net/search?q=context:global+timeout:300s+count:10+repo:%5Estash%5C.corp%5C.netflix%5C.com/%28PI%7CAE%29/.*%24+content:%22%28curl%7Cwget%29+.*+%5C%5C%7C+%28bash%7Csh%7Cpython%29%22+-content:%22netflix.%28com%7Cnet%29%22&patternType=regexp
Basically, I'm trying to find instances where people are downloading and running scripts from the outside internet (thus the exclusion of netflix domains). Would appreciate any pointers for crafting this query!
Suggested that the customer use the src cli in order to make use of the stream flag, which is not available in the web UI.
