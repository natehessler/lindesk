Client was using a regular expressions in both the content and repo portions of the query, but the. query string they are setting in the query variables object is missing patternType:regexp.
When you want to copy a query from the sourcegraph web UI into anything api/cli, you always want to use the official "copy to clipboard" button, just to the left of the search button.The highlighted blue button .\* tells you that you're using regular expression search instead of "literal" or "structural" search. The copy to clipboard button will inject the required modifiers into your query string. ![image (22)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85127819/142297956-8d71ac03-0f17-42be-996d-8eb18829e043.png)
