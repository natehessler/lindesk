Hello Team, I can't use sourcegraph now. (1st option not working second option redirecting to okta login) 1st option is continue with github: showing this No user exists matching any of the verified emails: thassanauny@gmail.com, tanvir.hassan@glovoapp.com.
This is typically associated with exhaustion of user seats or deleted users
Customer confirmed that the user's account had been deleted but they'll be able to access this tomorrow
