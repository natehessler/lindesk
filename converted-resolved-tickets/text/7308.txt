Customer thought that repo permissions were not syncing
Customer had to set 
    SELECT
      COUNT(repo.name)
    FROM
       repo
       LEFT JOIN repo_pending_permissions ON repo.id = repo_pending_permissions.repo_id
       LEFT JOIN repo_permissions ON repo.id = repo_permissions.repo_id
    WHERE
      repo.private
      AND repo.deleted_at IS NULL
      AND ARRAY_LENGTH(repo_pending_permissions.user_ids_ints, 1) = 0
      AND ARRAY_LENGTH(repo_permissions.user_ids_ints, 1) = 0;
