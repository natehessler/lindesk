-   Doc Update Link:
The customer was seeing the alert 'hard error search code-intel responses' fire a lot.
We saw some symbols errors in the frontend logs.\
We also saw other alerts which relate to underprovisioned instances. After looking at some of their yaml files, they had low resources and high resource usage.
The customer stopped responding, but these errors are related to low resources. The customer needed to add more symbols replicas and increase the resources for zoekt webserver.
