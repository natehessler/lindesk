The previous version of sourcegraph had a checkbox for sending notifications to my email for saved searches, but I noticed the new one does not. Will it send an email by default?
Code monitoring has essentially replaced saved searches. All you need to do to get notifications again, is to create a new code monitor in the code monitoring tab of sourcegraph, and set your trigger and configure your email.
