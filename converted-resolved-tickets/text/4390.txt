-   Doc Update Link:
The Customer was unable to get the content of a chained symlink ReadME file. it gets into an infinite loop going from blob to tree in the URL
-   I tried reproducing this to an extent. I created a symlink file  locally then uploaded to gitlab via the upload file button and tried to search it on k8 I was able to get the content of the file even tho its linked file wasn't uploaded.
-   Next was to create a chained symlink and I was able to recreate the same infinite loop going from blob to tree in the URL. Relevant slack thread. 
-   Steps to recreate:touch first.md
    -   ln -s first.md second.md
    -   ln -s second.md third.md
    -   ln -s third.md fourth.md
-   We would look into this internally. At this moment I can't give an ETA for a fix. However, I have filled a bug report: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/26957. If you would like to be updated you can definitely track via the link.
