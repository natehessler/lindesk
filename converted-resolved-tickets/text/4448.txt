I decided to work on issue https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/25216 , it has to do with the signup page which I couldn't access locally so I made changes using devtools to get the view in the second image, if I make the changes locally, how can I view it?  
Could you try running: SOURCEGRAPH_API_URL=https://sourcegraph.com (https://sourcegraph.com/) sg start web-standalone
