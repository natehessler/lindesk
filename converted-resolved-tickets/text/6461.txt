I understand that the customer is running a search, and looking for a file named FooError and this does not appear until page 7 in the Github search.
In sourcegraph, if looking for a file, you can make use of the file parameter and you get a result of files with the name. For instance, your search query would look like [this](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+file:FooError&patternType=literal)
N/A
