Customer is unable to receive emails for Observability when they added smtp configuration.
Asked the customer to add noVerifyTLS: true in their config to check if this might fix the issue. Unfortunately, they deprioritized this before resolution
This hasn't been resolved yet. I requested the customer to start a new thread to tackle this at a later date and closing this issue for now.
