For any query, customer was being shown there was were and were not results, but no results were returning. UI showing 500+ results, but no results were being listed out. Customer suspected permissions issue.
Confirmed that this user was the only one having this issue and asked for logs.
This issue was solved internally after the admins jumped in and checked the DB for this user, who only had access to 3000 repose as opposed to 9000. Resolving some github issues (unspecified by user) ended up solving the problem for him.
