Can you use a regex search in an insight? It does not seem to be working for me.
The answer to whether you can be able to use a regex search in an insight is yes. Say for example you'd like to track migrations of, CSS modules. Running: select:file lang:css file:module.css patterntype:regexp archived:no fork:no in your insight would generate a visuals plotted in a time series. Just to follow up with some questions if I may, would you mind sharing your query with me? I'd love to try to reproduce this on my instance. Also, any specific errors or lack of that you would like to share? Sometimes based on the number of repositories the search query in the insight spans, it may take quite a bit of time to generate a chart.
