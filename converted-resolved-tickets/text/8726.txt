Have you tested the sourcegraph docker compose setup with docker compose v2? If so, which versions of sourcegraph are compatible with it?
We haven't seen any issues with Docker Compose v2.5. We do use  service_completed_successfully which was introduced in Docker Compose v1.29 so that would be the minimum version required.
