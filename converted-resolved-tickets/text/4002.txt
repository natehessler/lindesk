The customer asked if you can search for a list of repos that contain a certain file name.
We had some issue with counts and patterns, but the answer is still yes.
Unfortunately, we didn't really resolve the counts/pattern stuff, but the customer seemed to have disengaged.
Can you conduct a search that returns a list of repos that contain a file that is named a certain name e.g. all repos that contain a "README" file?
Yes, using
