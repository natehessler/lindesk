The customer has been experiencing inconsistent search results when doing a literal search for PactConsumerTestExt vs PactConsumerTestExt repo:api. One search yields results and the other does not.
1.  Attempt the two searches separately as described above
2.  Checked the index of the Sourcegraph instance across two separate copies of zoekt-indexserver
3.  Found that the index across the two separate instances was identical instead of being shared across the two instances. ​
No resolution as I explained to the customer we have gone up against our best effort support. The customer explained that Nomad is not capable of stateful workloads. Research of my own had lead me to see that it is possible. A tech review however should be done to see how Sourcegraph would like to support the Nomad deployment. ​
