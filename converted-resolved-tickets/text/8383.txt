So I have this search-probe that is just a small binary that shells out to the src CLI and issues a search, roughly every second. But if I look at the graph for search latency that's using the query: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (le)(rate(src_search_streaming_latency_seconds_bucket\[5m\]))) I'm seeing gaps in my metrics, digging further I can see that it only ever has the source of browser but the CLI searches arrive as source unknown .Is there a good metric to measure the latency of all searches not just the streaming?

The customer reported that they mislabeled the source. It's other. Confirming how we handle CLI source. There's a fix here: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/35998 to continue tracking
