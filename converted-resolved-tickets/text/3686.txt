> Hey Kevin, this doc is a bit repetitious The instructions for kubernetes repeat the env vars that need to be set in the frontend pods deployment yamls. The only unrepeated parts in the general instructions pertain to the ALLOW_EDITS env vars (if you'd like to allow edits you'll need to set these in the same way as the other env vars)
