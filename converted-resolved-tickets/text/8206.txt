Hi team after I moved some repos under another project I am seeing this. Repository not found I have multiple repos that needs refreshed.
The site admin can trigger this sync manually by navigating to Site admin\>Repository status\>\$name_of_repo\>Settings\>Mirroring and clicking on Refresh nowThis will add the repo in the update queue and will give a timeframe when it'll be updated.
There's a repo update interval that does this automatically.
