The customer was not seeing the private repositories from their organization.\
The customer was guided to update their code host connection to their organization in Sourcegraph with the following instructions: ​
Make sure that the customer has an update to date PAT under the organization's code host connection (Click on the organization the user belongs to \> Settings \> Code Host Connections \> Update) ​ Should the user be using an SAML SSO to log into GitHub then that PAT will have to be authorized after it is generated as demonstrated here.
