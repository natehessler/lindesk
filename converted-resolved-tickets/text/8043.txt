The "pyproject.toml adoption" insight just finished, and it looks odd, in a permanent way. So there ends up being 2 points for May 2022, and thus I'm guessing it's confusing it.
This is expected -- it's the snapshot! This is so, if you had a datapoint, say, May 2nd, you don't have to wait until June 2nd to see new data -- by may 17th, it's possible/likely things have changed and it's still valuable to see this, so we include the snapshot. It will update daily.
