Customer wanted guidance on syncing their iOS repos that in previous attempts has taken a long time to sync with no conclusion
I tried to get more information about how big these repos are and how long they waited in trying to clone these repos just to get an idea of what they consider "a long time" vs what could actually be expected for repos of this size. So far I was able to gather that it's about 10% of their codebase but not sure of exact size. I wasn't able to get an answer on how long they waited in their previous attempts at cloning. I suggested our doc on using a local copy of the repo to speed the initial syncing process along. I didn't get a response about results or if they got the chance to attempt this but the seemed positive about giving this a try. For right now, this customer is working on a lot of other steps in getting deployed so it made sense to close this ticket for now.
