The Customer is having an issue when trying to preview batch changes.
My guess here is the code host token is taking time to sync. I asked if this was the first time you are trying out batch changes? Told the customer to add a -clear-cache flag/option to the src batch preview command and try again. Also, asked check that your src cli is on the latest version. please consider clearing cookies as well. Batch refresh rates depend on webhooks and the current sync rate.
Also, refreshing the repo manually does help in case this takes a long time.
