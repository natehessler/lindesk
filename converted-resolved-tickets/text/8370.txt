Customer seeks advice for migrating EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes to PV (Persistent Volumes), as recommended by Sourcegraph. Customer is intending on moving from an EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance to a EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster .
No specific recommendations from Sourcegraph for this procedure. The entities mentioned are pretty much all just AWS (Amazon Web Services) type entities/objects/concepts, so we don't recommend anything specific from our side.
At best, we have a small portion in our \[docs that mentions using EBS volumes\](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/deploy/docker-compose/aws
Instead, Application Engineer took a guess that customer is intending on going from a docker-compose deployment to a kubernetes deployment. For data migration as recommended by Sourcegraph, the process would be as such: - extract the postgres data from the docker-compose deploymeny by starting at \[this\](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/deploy/docker-compose
-   then seed the kubernetese deployment starting from \[here\](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/deploy/kubernetes/operations
