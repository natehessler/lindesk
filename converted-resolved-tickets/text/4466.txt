Hello,What do I do if I want to run a campaign on repos where I don't have write access? I get errors like this:
Failed to run operations on changeset Creating commit from patch for repository "github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/com.unity.performance-tracking": gitserver: pushing ref: exit status 128
Isn't forking in my user org an option?
Found that this is part of the Batch Changes team priorities(supporting batch changes on forks) for FY22Q4.
