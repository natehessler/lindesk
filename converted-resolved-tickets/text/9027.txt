can i highlight multiple lines in the codelinks i follow?
You can highlight multiple lines with a hypen e.g. L4-L10
This turned into a feature request since the customer wanted to be able to highlight several lines separately, not as a range. Currently the best workaround is to set up a Notebook with the individual lines highlighted.
