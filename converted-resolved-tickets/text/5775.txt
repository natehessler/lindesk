Diff search was not working for a particular string? Why?
Diff search is much more resource-intensive than regular search. Most normal searches are indexed, which means we can much more efficiently look up what documents the strings occur in. For diff searches, we have to iterate over every commit in the repos being searched, generate the difference between that commit and its parent commit (which is quite expensive), then search those differences. With large repos, this can make diff search time out before it finishes.
