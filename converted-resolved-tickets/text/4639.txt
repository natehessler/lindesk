When setting up initial authorization configurations, the admin is met with 'Could not verify user is part of the allowed GitHub organizations.' when trying to login through GitHub
-   Customer sent the initial issue report including the error message
-   I read the admin/auth docs: https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/auth
-   I found this note under GitHub auth that shows that GitHub needs to give the OAuth application access to each GitHub Organization to function
Shared this doc with the customer, issue resolved: https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/restricting-access-to-your-organizations-data/approving-oauth-apps-for-your-organization

    Could not verify user is part of the allowed GitHub organizations.
