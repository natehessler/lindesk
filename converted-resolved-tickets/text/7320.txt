how far back should we be able to go back for User stats?
User stats Information stored in the events log table has an [expiration](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/internal/usagestats/defaults.go?L4-6) date of about 3 months (hence the three-month time period charts on the usage page). I believe this explains why you are only able to recover data from the beginning of the year. This is actually something we've received a number of feature requests to store for longer and this is already on the product map.
