Migrating to 3.31.x and following the instructions at https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/migration/3_31
Errors were reported when checking for prior index corruption before upgrading. The instructions say to contact customer support to help repair the database if any errors are reported.
I ran the SQL query on the pgsql pod and got this result:
    ERROR: item order invariant violated for index "repo_name_unique"
    DETAIL: Lower index tid=(292,66) (points to heap tid=(4583,10)) higher index tid=(292,67) (points to heap tid=(1067,4)) page lsn=234/A8689358.
I also ran the SQL against the codeintel-db pod and no errors reported there.
After confirming with some other folks internally, seeing the error ERROR: item order invariant violated for index "repo_name_unique" indicates Db corruption. This will need to be cleaned up before upgrading. We have a document that will walk you through the process here: https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/how-to/rebuild-corrupt-postgres-indexes
-   Note that to be safe, we advise re-indexing both pgsql and codeintel-db via the process in the doc above
-   Keep in mind that the process will take some time
-   We also advise that once re-indexing is done, that the queries be ran again to make sure the corruption has been fixed
