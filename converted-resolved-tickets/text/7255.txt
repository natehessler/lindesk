> Hello! We're trying to setup webhooks in our Github instance to call out to the Sourcegraph repository-level refresh endpoint: https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/repo/webhooks
> It seems Sourcegraph expects the repository in the URL, but Github sends it as part of the request body. Is there a way to reconcile this difference and get near real-time repo indexing?
> It looks like there isn't currently a way to apply a single webhook to an organization to auto-index associated repos when there's an update. You could set webhooks up for individual repos, modeling the payload url after the curl example in the page you linked, but that would require a lot of overhead.Fortunately, this is something we've already identified to address internally - feel free to track progress in [this issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/31228).
