Seeing 
Honestly... I didn't do much troubleshooting in this ticket. *But* a decent set of questions of to ask/troubleshooting steps for this type of issue can include:
-   Assuming there's a code-file involved: What is the code file like? Large code files can impact the performance of code-intel. Also, the language of the code file can impact the performance of code-intel as well. The usual suspects are JavaScript, TypeScript, Scala and C
-   
-   There is *some* merit to checking provisioning /resource allocations/mem+cpu usage of these services, though the discussion generated by the [aforementioned RFH](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/801) is that the root of the issue is more likely to be the language of the code files, not a resource allocation to the services. Note that the other related issues tended to end in "resolution" either with a version upgrade, or a resource allocation, though I am suspect to believe that these are just band-aid solutions.
For now, just bumped the resources to 
So I'd say: No true resolution. Probably comes down to code-intel covering this ticket's use-cases i.e. code-intel for Dockerfiles, and code-intel for .proto files.
