The customer reported an issue with the -repo: filter not excluding any repos. They are on version 3.33 and are seeing this on their staging and production instance. The repo: filter works correctly and search seems to be working correctly too. I'm seeing this behavior on the frontend and the API Console.
I looked at logs for frontend and zoekt but there was nothing relevant. After doing some testing we found the -repo: filter only worked on public repos.
This seems to be a bug as I was able to replicate this behavior.
NA
There were no errors in frontend or webserver logs.
