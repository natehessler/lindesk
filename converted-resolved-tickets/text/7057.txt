How do I scale sourcegraph and up the resources in the docker compose file?
For how to set the frontends, in the docker-compose.yaml there's a note by the sourcegraph-frontend-0 stating that you'd want to apply changes there to the frontend-internal service as well. \

The resources you allocate depend on several factors that are deployment specific. I suggest referencing our resource estimator guide here . It's not perfect but it can give you a general idea of how much resources and where.
Also, a good place to check are the Grafana pages for specific services to see if they are showing high memory / cpu usage. For repo updating, those would be services like repo updater, frontend, and gitserver.
