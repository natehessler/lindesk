Hey team, I have an example of this issue again. Last time it went away without any particular changes. It'd be great to figure out what's going on here. Error:
Failed to run operations on changeset Creating commit from patch for repository "github.rbx.com/Roblox/sourcegraph-batch-test-1": gitserver: pushing ref: exit status 128 \$ git -c credential.helper- -c protocol.version-2 push --force https://‹redacted›@github.rbx.com/Roblox/sourcegraph-batch-test-1 715ef8eacf328 remote: Invalid username or password. fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.rbx.com/Roblox/sourcegraph-batch-test-1/'
The customer ended up resolving this by uploading a new token
