User was receiving a "Failed to run operations on changeset" error when attempting to run a batch change. Caused by not having permissions to push a branch to a particular repo.
Retried batch change manually, but did not work. He then asked:
Is there a sourcegraph way to fork the repo, push the branch to my fork, open a PR?
Malo from Batch changes jumped in and this became a how to/feature request ticket (see slack thread). Malo shared a public ticket where this issue is currently being worked on. Linked above.
