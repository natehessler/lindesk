After upgrading our QA Sourcegraph cluster to 3.35.1, we started triggering the following alert:
This appears to be new and we can't view the documentation on this at the moment. Looking at the logs for the frontend pods does reveal repeated errors around a missing route:
We removed query-runner in 3.35, but we are seeing some customers still have it deployed due to Kustomize overlays which are overriding the removal of the base manifest.
Query runner should be removed from deployment if customer is 3.35 or higher. It causes frontend latency and the failed calls that the customer reported.
