The Customer is using the Sourcegraph browser extension in firefox and they are unable to get codecov to work using the sourcegraph firefox extension.
-   I was trying to troubleshoot this on a call with them, I did a simple test using the firefox extension by visiting [tuf_store.go in theupdateframework/notary on GitHub in my firefox browser](https://github.com/theupdateframework/notary/blob/master/server/storage/tuf_store.go) and I was unable to see the codecov toggle button which I see on my chrome.
Firefox extension doesn't support codecov.
