User complaining of frequent 504's (gateway timeouts) for parallel API search queries. This was a new issue that wasn't happening when she did similar actions before.
While looking at a trace Ty noticed that her one regex wasn't properly escaped. Escaping the one character lead to her script executing super fast. That solves this issue.
This is likely a common problem. I filed a follow-up issue was filed.
