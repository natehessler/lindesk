This was ultimately stumbling blocks in getting Sourcegraph set up. Misconfig and lack of resources to pods.
They accidentally tried to externalize the Code Insights DB. It cannot be run externally because its a timescale DB. 3.35.0 Has problems with Code Insights - we let them know and they switched install to 3.35.1 PVs were lingering from previous attempts to start the product Lack of resources to pods - needed to use the resource calculator
