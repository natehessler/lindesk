Customer had a previous kubernetes instance of sourcegraph that she used to create an API key. After tearing that instance down and creating a new instance, she was still able to use the same API key to auth into the src CLI.
This was difficult to troubleshoot. In the middle of doing so the customer replied and said that the old API key was no longer working.
Strange behavior seems to have spontaneously stopped. I am posting a summary here in case this ever comes up again. Seems like a strange issue and one that we definitely want to resolve should we find it again, but I could not find anything relevant in the docs/logs.
