The customer was not able to clone any repos into Sourcegraph. The customer has a self-managed GitLab instance that requires an internally signed SSL certificate in order to be accessed.
The customer was able to successfully clone repos from Sourcegraph as follows:
1.  exec into the gitserver pod
2.  create the file /etc/gitconfig
3.  contents of /etc/gitconfig
\[http\] sslcainfo = /etc/ssl/certs/rootCA.pem
4.  add pem file to /etc/ssl/certs/rootCA.pm
For a permanent fix, the customer is currently using the experimental tls.external flag located in the example site config here.
