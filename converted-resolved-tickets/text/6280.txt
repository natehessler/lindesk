After doing some testing and research I can confirm that yes, all of the operations on the linked page you shared except Batch Changes would work as planned.The read_api  scope will not work as it does not have any write permissions in order to write to the targeted repos in a batch change spec.You would have to add the write_repository scope to that token as well.This probably wasn't documented on our side due to the fact at the time our documentation was written the read_api scope was new. (est. in 2020, I checked the commit history on the docs page you were looking at and it was written about 2 years ago, we may have just missed it).Of course, if you have any further questions, please let me know :simple_smile:
