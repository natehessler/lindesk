The customer provided a snippet of code that could be potentially used for a Vim/Neovim compatible Sourcegraph Plugin.
The customer asked if we could consider adding the snippet of code to our list of supported integrations.
I let the customer know that we have taken their suggestion under consideration and it has been added to the Extensibility team's backlog.
