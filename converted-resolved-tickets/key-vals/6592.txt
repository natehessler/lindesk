Summary: Customer running into following error when creating a batch change:
Consulted with colleagues, webhooks not being enabled was identified as the very likely cause. Confirmed with customer that they were not enabling webhooks.
They cannot use webhooks because it will cause other errors for them. From Ricardo:
"Unfortunately, enabling webhook will result in other errors for us. The webhooks will notify Soucegraph about all repos, including repos our Sourcegraph instance does not have access to."
