Summary: I just searched for the error message in our resolved-tickets, and found [this one](https://github.com/sourcegraph/support-tools-internal/blob/c063886938a2a24dc640f4adfa905244b17a051a/resolved-tickets/7081.md) HEHEHE. The resolved ticket mentioned scaling, so I made the same recommendation.
Scaling/resource-allocation recommended. Not yet confirmed if it solved anything though. But customer seems convinced. Me too lolz.
