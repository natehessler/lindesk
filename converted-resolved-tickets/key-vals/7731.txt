Summary: Sourcegraph URL site can't be reached.
-   Drawing from the previous context I see this is something that also happened recently.
-   Can the Sourcegraph site admin confirm that the sourcegraph cluster is up and running?
-   Sourcegraph was down in their Cluster as a result of an internal issue which was fixed and everything is back to normal.
