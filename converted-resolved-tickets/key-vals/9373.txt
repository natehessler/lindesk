Summary: Hi teams, I tested the batch change feature. I have write permission but have the Branch protection rules so that I can not merge to any branch directly. (our registered users can merge after reviewing by gerrit tools). And I try to run batch changes with that repository, and publish batch set. The status is Unpublished even though I click "publish on apply", and the Action field shows "No Action". Is it right flow? what means "No action" ?
