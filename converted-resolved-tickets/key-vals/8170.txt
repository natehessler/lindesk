Summary: Hi, I'm getting this error while trying to apply the batch as draft, any thoughts how to fix it?
I confirmed that this is a known bug that has just been recently fixed in version 3.39.0 , it was highlighted here in the changelogs under the fixed items. I have noticed that the customer's instance is currently on 3.37.0 and that's why they're still experiencing this.
I suggested the following possible workaround pending when their instance is upgraded, which are: apply the batch spec without setting the publication state, then use bulk actions on the batch change to set the publication state. set published: draft or published: true (docs) in the batch spec, and re-apply (this one is more strongly recommended )
