Summary: We are experiencing an issue where a project is not being indexed in Sourcegraph. The highlighted project below "XD/icagraphicswin", is configured in the "Manage code hosts" section, however, even after selecting "Update Repositories" it does not display in the list of indexed projects.
Surrounding projects in this lists such as "XD/icagraphics" are indexed via Sourcegraph. The Bitbucket permissions are identical between "XD/icagraphics", and XD/icagraphicswin".
Checked repo-updater logs Checked the database for last sync errors Checked external_sync_jobs table for entries
Deleting the external_sync_jobs entry in the table freed up and caused a new job to queue and therefore solved the issue.
