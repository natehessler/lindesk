he error looks like the certificate provided isn't valid, but lets double check to rule that out. Can you run the below command to know if this certificate is correct or valid? curl --cacert /path/to/cert https:\
Next, if you have verified that the cert is correct, then attempt to clone a repo in the gitserver pod using GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true git clone 
Finally, if that works then, the below can be added to the Global config pane which allows you turn off TLS SSL verification when contacting the code host.
    "experimentalFeatures": {
        "tls.external": {
          "certificates": [
            "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n..."
          ],
          "insecureSkipVerify": true
        }
      },
"Ok.. I got this working once I hacked the gitserver pod and added our certs to /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt."
