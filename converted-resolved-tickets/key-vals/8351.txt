Summary: All the repositories we added to the organization "finpension" are gone and are not appearing when re-adding them.
Raised this to the cloud team and we figured that GitLab made a breaking change that affects our integration with this code host. All users/customers using GitLab.com, and who have upgraded their on-perm GitLab to the version \>= 15.0 are believed to be affected. Older GitLab version that have OAuth access token expiry enabled would also experience this problem.
Gitlab no longer supports tokens without an expiry date And the OAuth token expiration time is \[two hours\](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html
We made some [modifications](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/36042) to our code base to mitigate this issue
