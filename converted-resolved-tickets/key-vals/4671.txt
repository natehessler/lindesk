Summary: Can we share some stats how many repos were loaded into sourcegraph - percentage wise?
I've been digging into this to try and find a solution but it seems that we can only be able to serve a totalCount of repos synced into Sourcegraph via a GraphQL query.I know this isn't what you were looking at getting but I wonder if this would be of some help? This is not currently available
