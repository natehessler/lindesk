Summary: The customer was seeing the following error when attempting to make a batch change: Failed to run operations on changeset. Creating commit from patch repository....pushing ref: exit status 128
I moved my SSH keys in \~/.ssh to a different location so git won't use them. I did unset SSH_AUTH_SOCK so gitserver won't access the keyagent that's still running on macOS I started sg start
This turned out to be a bug that was broken from 3.27. Thorsten from batch changes helped with the fix.
