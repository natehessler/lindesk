Summary: Hi, so since getting the VS code extension working, I've run into some issues that I wanted to highlight: 1. While the search itself is fast, opening a file is not. In the video attached, it takes \~11 seconds just to open a search result in a new tab. Is this expected? 2. By right clicking on a specific line of code and copying the sourcegraph file links, the link itself always sends me to the line before (e.g., if I want to copy a link to line 35 of a file, the link itself goes to line 34 instead). Is this the desired behavior? Or maybe it's conflicting with some other extension I have installed?
None thus far. Customer hasn't responded in 4 days. Closing this and will re-open when it's responded to.
None
