Summary: Failed to run operations on changeset Post "http://gitserver:3178/create-commit-patch": dial tcp: lookup gitserver on 169.254.0.1:53: no such host ​ ​Above 95% memory usage for 32GB gitserver service.
For this error message we have historically seen that the gitserver resources are under-provisioned.Increasing the memory allocation as well as the count of the gitserver Task group  should help this issue.I am not sure however if increasing the count of Task group that houses gitserver will affect the other services that reside in the Task group.
