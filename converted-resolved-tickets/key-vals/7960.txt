Summary: What am I doing wrong here:
    ‚ûú  ~ echo $SRC_ENDPOINT && echo $SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN
    https://shipt.sourcegraph.com (https://shipt.sourcegraph.com/)
    my-actual-token-here
    ‚ûú  ~ src login "https://shipt.sourcegraph.com (https://shipt.sourcegraph.com/)"   
    ‚ùå Problem: No access token is configured.
    üõ†  To fix: Create an access token at https://customer-instance.com/user/settings/tokens, then set the following environment variables:
       SRC_ENDPOINT=https://customer-instance.com (https://customer-instance.com/)
       SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN=(the access token you just created)
       To verify that it's working, run this command again.
    ‚ûú  ~ src version  
    Current version: 3.39.1
    Recommended version: 3.39.1 or later
Sending a curl request with the token worked. 
Setting the env vars in the same command worked: 
The customer wasn't exporting the environment variables correctly. This worked:
    export SRC_ENDPOINT=https://customer-instance.com
    export  SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN=token
