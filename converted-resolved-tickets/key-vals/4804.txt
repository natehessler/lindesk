Summary: The customer was curious about a confusing UI banner message. Text below:
    It looks like you're using Docker for Mac. Due to known issues related to 
    Docker for Mac's file system access, search performance and cloning 
    repositories on Sourcegraph will be much slower.
    Run Sourcegraph on a different platform or deploy it to a server for much
    faster performance.
The customer uses a pure-docker deployment, so they should not be receiving this message. This message is meant for customers using a single-container docker deployment, not for custom, multi-container pure-docker deployments.
I informed the customer to disregard the message and explained why he was receiving it. I also filed a feature request to ask for a conditional to be added that would check for pure-docker deployments before serving the message.
