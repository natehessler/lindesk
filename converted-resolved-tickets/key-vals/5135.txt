Summary: we want to obtain a list of every single repo searchable within SourceGraph (and avoid copy and pasting out of the UI)
You can you try running this \$ src repos list -first='-1' instead, this is to get the list of all repositories, which may be slow.
Also to get the un-indexed repos, running the following command should give you that \$ src repos list -not-indexed
You can also run a search like src search -json 'select:repo count:all'  in the CLI to get the list of all repos or even in the UI search query and export to CSV
Another way is to use the GraphQl to get the list of repos by running the following query:
This will get the list of un-indexed repos: {
    repositories(notIndexed:true){
           nodes {
                name
                 url
           }
      }
}
2.  First 1000 repos: { repositories(first:1000){ nodes { name url } } }
