Summary: Seeing this error in vscode with sourcegraph extension, anything to worry about?
Your Sourcegraph instance version is not fully compatible with the Sourcegraph extension. Please ask your site admin to upgrade to version 3.32.0 or above. Read more about version support in our \[troubleshooting docs\](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/how-to/troubleshoot-sg-extension
Alright after a little investigation, I see that your instance is currently running in v3.34.1 -- if thats the case, I believe this error message is a known bug with an issue here, and resolution here.Was this your first time loading the extension?
