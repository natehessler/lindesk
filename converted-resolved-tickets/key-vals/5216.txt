Customer's new instance failes to clone large monorepo.
Have customer attempt to clone into a new ec2 instance (this times out)
Summary: -   Have the customer report the error message from gitserver
-   Customer reports that configuring the gitLongCommandTimeout solves the issue, as their monorepo takes more than the default 1hr time limit to clone
