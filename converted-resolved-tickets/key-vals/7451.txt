Summary: How do I return content of files from a stream search without using src?
you have to trick the API into returning the file contents by using select: content then using the regex for select everything .\*. i.e.:
src search -stream "r:sourcegraph/sourcegraph file:.yml select:content .\* count:all patternType:regexp
