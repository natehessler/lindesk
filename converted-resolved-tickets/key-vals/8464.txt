Summary: ​can we get someone on the call that knows about the oauth process? ​ ​one engineer can't login and the other gets this, which routes to my user account for some reason ​ \[SCREENSHOT\]
​​A call with the customer CE Nate Maynard, AppE Amber Furbush and myself was had. The customer was told that the GitHub sign-in flow that they were experiencing was working as intended.
They were given instruction on how to create a GitHub App under an organization rather than an individual user in order to get around their SSO being dependent on one user having access.
