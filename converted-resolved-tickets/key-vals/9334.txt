Summary: ​​We use a few open source packages in our TypeScript repo (rxjs, angular, react, etc). I see that those repositories are searchable with code intelligence in the sourcegraph public deployment (example: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/-/blob/src/operators/index.ts). Is it possible to configure our private deployment to support "go to definition" for those external dependencies used in our code? ​ /////////////////FOLLOW UP QUESTION//////////////////// ​ I've already setup SCIP for our repository and "Go to definition" doesn't work for public packages, it only works for packages whose repos exist within our deployment. Like I have a piece of code: import {Observable, Subject} from 'rxjs';
In that code rxjs is third party dependency that we have (https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs). I want to be able to click on Observable and go to the definition in that third party repository-- is that possible?
​​What you are seeing on soucegraph.com is the enablement of precise code intelligence which is done by performing lsif uploads on the repositories that you would like the ability to navigate the symbols of.You can enable this functionality on your private deployment as well. The linked documentation should send you into the correct direction. ​ /////////////////FOLLOW UP ANSWER//////////////////// ​ ​What you are describing is our cross-repository code intelligence functionality.It seems your colleague Gerry Gao is aware of the functionality. In this specific case, you would need to import the ReactiveX/rxjs repository into your Sourcegraph deployment and perform an upload of LSIF data for the repo. ​
