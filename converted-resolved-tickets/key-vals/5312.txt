Summary: "Is it preferable to run grafana customized version or could sourcegraph reference instead our shared instance?"
"It's not really clear what should be the value for GRAFANA_SERVER_URL?"
Generically answered that it's best to just run whatever Sourcegraph packages, as "custom" or highly individualized infrastructures tend to run into unique issues.
Was unable to find a good answer regarding GRAFANA_SERVER_URL , and would probably need a colleague to answer/understand this. Fortunately, the question didn't come up again and the customer seemed okay with relinquishing their concern.
None
Logs though: Grafana endpoint proxying: Please set env var GRAFANA_SERVER_URL
