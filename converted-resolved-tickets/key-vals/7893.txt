Summary: Is there a GraphQL endpoint to get user data, when someone logged in, how many users logged in by hour. Would that come for the postgres DB for some other?
This data comes from the users table, just made easier to digest /site-admin/usage-statistics The options for activePeriod, are "TODAY", "THIS_WEEK", "THIS_MONTH", and "ALL_TIME". The smallest granularity is by day, so filtering by hour would be a feature request. Jonah has shared this feedback with the product team.
