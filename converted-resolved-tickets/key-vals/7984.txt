Summary: I want to search non-archived reference of AnnotatedCompositeSerializer , this is my search AnnotatedCompositeSerializer archived:no lang:java and I got this reference from the 4th result. But app owner confirmed that this repo was archived. Can you let me know if my search is correct?
We get the 'archived' status by checking the "archived" label on the repo. Does this repo have the 'archived' label applied on BB?
