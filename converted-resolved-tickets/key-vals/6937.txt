Summary: The customer saw some repos stuck with the message 'Cloning in progress, starting clone".
Looked at logs for repo-updater and gitserver.\
Found this error in repo-updater:\
Got a new set of gitserver/repo-updater logs and saw a lot of latency errors.\
Gitserver seemed to be having network issues and was using 95% memory. I suggested bumping up resources but a restart of gitserver cleared the issue. It seems like the database failure caused some cleanup jobs to be stuck in failing loops.
