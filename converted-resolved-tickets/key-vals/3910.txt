Doc Update Link: None
Summary: src-cli was not running a command, and client asks for support. Application engineer thought that seeking info from the .yaml file would be helpful, but it wasn't related, which may have been a bit of a misfire, unfortunately.
Ultimately, it was a code bug. Not sure how an Application Engineer would be able to surface though, unfortunately. At best, this summary connects the error message to the fix, but doesn't provide a full, learnable lesson.
src batch repos was firing an error message.
None, unfortunately. Asking for the .yaml file may actually have been a misfire in this case, as the application engineer never gave a reason to investigate it. Best to provide customer justification for action.
The error message was a result of a bug in the source code. Upgrading to src-cli to 3.32.1 was mentioned \[here\](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/533
