Summary: A customer observed that hover tooltips weren't working for go generics on lsif indexed repos
After a brief review of our github issues internally I found that indeed we haven't yet developed lsif that covers generics, notified code-intel to help them identify and prioritize
See GitHub issues: https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-go/issues/240
