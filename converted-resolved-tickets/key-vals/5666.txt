Summary: The Customers has quite a lot of questions about LSIF: - tsconfig.json files not in the root but instead in a subdir like ui/ or multiple tsconfig.json files in the same repo, but in multiple subdirs - Composite repos containing tsconfig.app/base/spec/config.json which extended tsconfig.json - Multi-language repos where tsconfig.json is in js/src/ subdir - Is there a way to help the lsif-tsc tool understand how to process repos where there is tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, tsconfig.spec.json, etc in the root of a ts/js project ?
-   When using lsif-tsc for configuration files that do not exist in the root directory of the repository, we suggest that you navigate to the directory containing the configuration file and run lsif-tsc -p . 
-   Regarding your second question, on each repository's index page in Sourcegraph, there is a Code Intelligence tab in which you can view all the uploads for that particular repository. In addition, administrators of the Sourcegraph instance can see the global LSIF uploads across the entire instance from the Uploads tab under the Code Intelligence section on the left-hand side of the page. 
-   We are currently working to improve the lsif-node. I know lsif-node (same as lsif-tsc, just the name of the repo vs. cli binary) has special logic to detect tsconfig.json but not the .app.json and .spec.json variants. You would have to run the lsif -tsc -p at the root of multiple workspaces.
-   It might also be worth mentioning that we already use lsif-node together with yarn workspaces and composite TypeScript projects.
