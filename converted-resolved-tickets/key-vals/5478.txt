ave moved Sourcegraph PostgreSQL DB to a shared cluster and removed the built-in PostgreSQL instance. How can we have Grafana now report on the shared PG instance?
on't have a standard way to configure this, but we recommend using Prometheus Federation to consume external metrics. Grafana would have to be configured as well to consume these metrics as well.
