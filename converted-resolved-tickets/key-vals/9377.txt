Summary: I tried to set up email alerts as described here, but I'm now seeing this error message. Prometheus must be running though, since I can query it via the built in grafana
N/A
We did ship a fix here.
We can add the following flag to the docker manifest as a workaround for now -e PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:9090 (http://localhost:9090/)
The docker run command will then be: docker run --publish 7080:7080 --publish 127.0.0.1:3370:3370 --rm --volume \~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph --volume \~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph -e PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:9090 (http://localhost:9090/) sourcegraph/server:3.34.2
