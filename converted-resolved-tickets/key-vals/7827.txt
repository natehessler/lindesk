Summary: Also, in regards to the above screenshot, another thing I see is that enabling alerts starts to show the yellow banner with "observability.alerts and observability.silenceAlerts" still stays there. Do we need to do any other configuration changes?
We can add the following flag to the docker manifest
-e PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:9090 The docker run command will then be: docker run --publish 7080:7080 --publish 127.0.0.1:3370:3370 --rm --volume \~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph --volume \~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph -e PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:9090 sourcegraph/server:3.39.0
Long term fix here: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/34597
