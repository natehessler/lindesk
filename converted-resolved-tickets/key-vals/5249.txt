Summary: I noticed our kubernetes frontend deployment doesn't call out the INDEXED_SEARCH_SERVERS variable with all of the 14 zoekt endpoints we currently have. Is that just being handled by kubernetes auto-discovery or something?
The answer then is pretty short in that Kubernetes does everything automatically for service discovery for index server endpoints.
