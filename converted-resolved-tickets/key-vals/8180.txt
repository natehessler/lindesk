Summary: We had a change to our Gerrit server yesterday. They changed permission on one of the main repo's manage. When I check the Manage Repo-\>Failed fetch/clone, it lists the manage repo. When I click the Settings  box, I get an Empty repository
Checked the logs for errors with the manage repo but we didn't see any errors.\
We attempted to clone the repo from inside gitserver and this worked so we ruled out any connection errors.
We added the repo the exclude list and removed it manually from gitserver. The repo might have become corrupted when their code host settings changed.
