Summary: Hi. After installing the sourcegraph chrome plugin I expected to see a new icon at the top right on github.cds but it is not there. Am I missing an extra step? Thanks! Would you know how to install the sourcegraph app to a new github org?
Update the SG URL on the extension to their hosting URL I forwarded the link to our doc on how to configure a new code host with either repo or org
