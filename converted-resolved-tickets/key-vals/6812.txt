Summary: One of the questions I had is if there is a way to use negative lookahead regex. E.g. to find all repositories using any but latest version of a certain module.
Customer figured that they can use -content to exclude text from results.
I also wanted to suggest using the following flags as well.repo:contains.content($module_name) would be able to return all repositories that contain a specific module or repo:contains.file($file_name) would return all repositories with the file that matches the regex query.Of course these two can also work with the exclude filter and would just need adding a - to the filter itself.I hope this also helps.
