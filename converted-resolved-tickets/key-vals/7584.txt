Summary: I was looking at setting up some search context based on some labelling files we have in our repos but ran into this issue.
It seems like I can't use a content: filter for these. Would it be possible to support it in the future?
The query I used to use to setup repo groups was this so ideally I'd like to reuse them if possible.
select:repo file:.github/rvu/labels.yaml content:airship
Perhaps we could try with the repo:contains.file(..) and file:contains.content(..) filters? This query; select:repo file:.github/rvu/labels.yaml content:airship would transform to; repo:contains.file(labels.yaml) AND file:contains.content(airship) Would you be open to giving this a try?
