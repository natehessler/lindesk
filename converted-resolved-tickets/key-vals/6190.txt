Summary: Structural Search: how do I search for a class with a parent class? This seems to be highlighting everything, not just the class definition.
I've also tried: • class :\[class_name\] \
Answered by Rijnard: So the thing is, in Ruby, blocks of expressions are delineated by keywords like module ... end (similar to how you'd delineate blocks in other languages using { ... } ). In Comby, your patterns need to be valid for that language, so if you tried to write a pattern like { ... it wouldn't match in a language where braces are always expected to be balanced and well-formed. The same goes for block keywords in Ruby. So the answer to your question is: add the end keyword in the places where you'd like the block to stop matching: bit.ly/3oElKDI
and (module :\[namespace\])\* class :\[class\] ... end (end)\* isn't a thing, right?\
nope, but you can submatch on nested blocks with rules https://comby.dev/docs/advanced-usage
unfortunately no, there's no way to highlight just capture groups. we're working on more general purpose tooling that will let you extract any/all of this though
