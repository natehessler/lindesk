Summary: 1.       Currently .sv files in our Sourcegraph cluster do not have syntax highlighting. We have the sourcegraph/Verilog extension installed and enabled. I see the public Sourcegraph instances has highlighting for .sv files, so I am hoping we just have a misconfiguration. 2.       Search for enums appears to be missing in .sv files -- when you hover over an enum variable, there is no popup with the value (we can see this behavior working in C++). I am curious if this is a missing feature or potentially a bug.
Yes you understood everything correctly.
I'd like to pick your brain on what you would feel is a valid approach here (P.S. Both options are valid and do work just as fine)
Option 1: Since SystemVerilog is derived from Verilog, would you prefer to have .sv files highlighted as Verilog files? The reason I ask is because the LanguageSpec for Verilog currently includes .sv file extensionss as evidenced here. In this case, the configuration would only require updating the syntaxHighlighting config to:
{ "syntaxHighlighting": { "languages": { "extensions": { "systemverilog": "verilog" }, "patterns": \[\] } }
Option 2: Using the steps you mentioned above, this would create highlighting specifically for SystemVerilog(as of now, as you may have noticed, we don't have SystemVerilog).
To answer your question, once merged, the files will highlight without requiring any additional configuration.
I hope this helps.
