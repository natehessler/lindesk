Summary: Customer wanted to know if it's possible to retry failed batch changes automatically.
There is some automation in place that will retry batch changes that aren't fully carried out the first time but once a changeset is marked as failed, that could indicate that user intervention is needed so for this reason, it isn't automatically re-enqueued
