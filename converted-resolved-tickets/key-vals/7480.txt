Summary: A customer reports being unable to access repos that their teammates can -- suspecting an error in the registration of their username.
This is an obvious permissions issue
The users admin confirmed that the users email had been registered in okta incorrectly. yes - there was a bad mapping in okta towards sourcegraph - fixed it - need to delete your account again - sorry
