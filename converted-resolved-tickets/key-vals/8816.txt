Summary: Is it possible add people to an "Organization" created in our Atlassian installation of Sourcegraph? I created one via the UI, can see its settings all fine, but I don't think I can invite any of my teammates? The UI has an option to invite and says this when I use it, but despite the message they haven't received anything, nor they can access the dashboard I am intending to share with them. Any clues?
-   checked to find out if they have their SG instance is configured to send email.
The admin confirming that this isn't configured. This explains the problem they are encountering. We also have a detailed [doc](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/config/email) on configuring sourcegraph to send emails using an SMTP server of your choose.
Asked the admin to do the following as an admin:
-   Add people to the organisation created manually on the organisation page until email is configured.
To unblock your ability to share insights, you can do one of a few things:
1.  You can ask your site admin to: - Create a global dashboard (admins should be able to create global dashboards) that you can then add insights to
-   Add people to the organisation manually on the organisation page until email is configured
-   A possible easier solution for your admin is just have them add [everyone on the instance to this org](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/organizations), effectively side-stepping the global restriction of (1).
2.  Your admin would need to upgrade your sourcegraph instance -- you're on 3.34.
-   In 3.37+, you'll have the option to create globally-visible dashboards regardless of being a site admin
-   In 3.40+, [you'll get direct share links on individual insights](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/release/3.40) (but will still need people to be part of an organisation, or still need to be able to create a global dashboard).
