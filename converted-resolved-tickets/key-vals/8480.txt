Summary: Hi Sourcegraph support!I am from Security Intelligence team, and investigating an incident and in need of access logs for SourceGraph. I was in contact with @rene as well. We need to get a copy the access logs for SourceGraph since 2022-05-09T00:00:00Z.  If I understand correctly, you will need to provide some instructions for our KITT team to use admin access into the KITT namespace to pull the access logs out of kubernetes.
Gotcha, the web UI doesn't present any access credentals for kubectl so we should be good on that front.There is a UI available to admins to look at a users actions/pages visited on Sourcegraph, but to my understanding a database dump of event_logs associated with a user is probably more in line with what you're after. I'll need to look into the correct query to run here to get you this data.In the meantime a user with admin access on your Sourcegraph instance can view a users usage events at this page https://$DOMAIN-NAME/users/$USER/settings/event-log (screenshot attached) -- unfortunately this is just a list with ordering options. SQL queries will probably be much more useful.
