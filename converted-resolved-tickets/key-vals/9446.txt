Summary: Customer had questions about the types of results they were getting as references in some of their files.
The references can be either search-based or precise. Precise code intelligence relies on LSIF data to provide the kind of references you're looking for. When this data is not available, sourcegraph falls back on search-based results, which are matches for the keyword.
