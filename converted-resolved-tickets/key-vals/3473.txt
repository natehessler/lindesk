Doc Update Link:
Summary: After installing Sourcegraph and adding API key, admin-level users only see 95 repos instead of expected 148 repos
-   Check repo-updater logs and grafana, but found no errors or performance issues
-   Grafana shows repo-updater sync queue managing less than 148 repos, so issue is not sync errors, but GitHub API not returning all repos
-   This suggests an API Key permissions level issue, so ask admin to issue a new API Key
New GitHub API Key installed, users now able to see all expected repositories
