Summary: query{ repository(name: "gitlab.booking.com/core/main") { comparison(base: "a6c2cbdccf691a2b8032c1d0da65a34a70e3ad72", head: "a6c2cbdccf691a2b8032c1d0da65a34a70e3ad70") { commits { nodes{ oid parents { oid } } } } } }
sending this to the API a6c2cbdccf691a2b8032c1d0da65a34a70e3ad72 is not a valid commit, and the reponse takes quite sometime to tell me revision not found.While for both valid commits is instant
Tried this https://cse-k8s.sgdev.org/api/console
This was instant.
Tried
query { repository(name: "github.com/visgl/react-map-gl") { comparison(base: "be0e126c", head: "be0e126b") { commits { nodes{ oid parents{ oid } } } } } }
Tried this query on dotcom and it brought back the revision not found in about 10 to 15 seconds
