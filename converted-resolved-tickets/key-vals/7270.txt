Summary: Hi @Luke T and @Ajay, We got the everything set to begin with the repositories synchronization, but for some reason Sourcegraph can't clone the repositories, the gitserver-1 log shows the following error: t=2022-03-30T21:02:05+0000 lvl=warn msg="error cloning repo" repo=github.com/mercadolibre/fury_gh-proxy err="error cloning repo: repo github.com/mercadolibre/fury_gh-proxy not cloneable: exit status 128 (output follows)
Is it necessary to grant write permissions to clone repositories?:thread: (edited)
Hey @Carlos Rondon Sourcegraph is going to requires a token with access to all of the scopes listed under repo -- write:org is generally not required, but is good to have for permissions sync sometimesCould you generate a token with full repo scope and try it out? Some docs on this.
I suspect it wants the security_events scope here
