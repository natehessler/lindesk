Summary: How hard is to to set up an AWS Code Commit provider for Sourcegraph to index? Is that something that could be done in QA in a few hours?
Looking at the docs it doesn't look too difficult. It feels like a few hours is reasonable.
AWS code commit is not yet supported with the Sourcegraph browser extension.
