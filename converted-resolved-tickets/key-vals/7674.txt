Summary: customer reports single-container sourcegraph server instance crashes when executing a search
ask about instance scale customer shares they have disabled search indexing
disabled search indexing forces all searches to go through Searcher instead of Indexed Search, which causes high RAM usage, causing the server to OOM. Re-enabling search indexing allows searches to resolve as expected
