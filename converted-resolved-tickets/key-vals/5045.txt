Summary: -   Doc Update Link:
Steps to reproduce:
Attempted to update some batch changes after they have been published Most of those changes are now in an error state and failing with errors like:
Updated step: This looks like it could have been caused by changing the PR title and/or description in the batch change. Reverting the title/description changes appears to get sourcegraph back in a better state.
Expected behavior: Batch change should succeed without error or not get stuck in a failed state.
Actual behavior: Stuck in a failed state.
This is a bug in this version. Update sourcegraph to version where it's fixed!
