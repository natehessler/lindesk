Summary: The customer provided the following batch change error parsing batch spec: failed to normalize JSON: yaml: line 10: mapping values are not allowed in this context. ​ ​ ​
​​From my research, it would seem that wrapping the offending string in single quotes  'BK_BUILD_TYPE:' would allow for valid YAML.
