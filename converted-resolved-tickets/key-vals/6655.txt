Summary: It does not seem like I can use a structural search with the type: diff filter. Is there another way to set up a code monitor for my use case?
Code Monitors don't support structural searches. Multiline search is also a current limitation with diff searches. I believe the best workaround at this time would be to track all changes to the file.
