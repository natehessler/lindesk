Doc Update Link:
Summary: Customer saw these errors in their frontend logs: lvl=eror msg="syntax highlighting failed (this is a bug, please report it) and wanted to understand what this meant.
On Sourcegraph, search for a file and hover a piece of code. If possible, if you know a large file, try doing this as well. Chances are this may fail.
This does require a retry as large files take some time to have their content highlighted. Also, this is a sign of a resource problem as per https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/739
