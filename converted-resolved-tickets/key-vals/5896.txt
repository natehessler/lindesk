Summary: How to setup repo groups and where to define them.
You can create a repogroup alias in your user settings using "search.repositoryGroups": {}
You'd define the URL's of the repositories in the group in the curly braces.This would look like:
"search.repositoryGroups": {       "repoGroupName": \[     "excodehost.com/example/example_repo1" "excodehost.com/example/example_repo2" "excodehost.com/example/example_repo3" \], },
