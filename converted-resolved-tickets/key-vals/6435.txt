Summary: SRC not working on Colima docker
I am trying to run batch change from my localhost Mac with Apple silicon and I am getting an error as:
gitlab.skypicker.com/infra/finance/sandbox: creating workspace: preparing local git repo: preparing workspace: Docker output: docker: Error response from daemon: invalid mount config for type "bind": bind source path does not exist: /tmp/src-run-3546096955. See 'docker run --help'.: exit status 125
Maybe you have seen such issues before? Do you have any hints
Workaround: Set SRC_BATCH_TMP_DIR to a directory that is definitely available within the Docker VM. For example, I think that would be /tmp/colima in Colima case
