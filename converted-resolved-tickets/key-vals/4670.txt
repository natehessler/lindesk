Summary: Github extras Extension Tab stuck on http://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraphgithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
-   Decided to find out how they got the GitHub tab because it's not in the default UI.
-   Found out it's a GitHub extras extension. It's a work in progress and in the experimental stage.
-   Asked them to disable that extension.
-   This can do this by marking that extension as disabled for all on their extensions page.
