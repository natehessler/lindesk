Summary: The customer received the error Unable to write external service config as it contains redacted fields, this is likely a bug rather than a problem with your config.
The customer was essentially adding the word REDACTED to the site config and this triggered an error in Sourcegraph internally since that is not a valid access token value. This was explained to the customer and the customer was directed on how to access their unencrypted database to find their plain text access token from their existing production instance of Sourcegraph.
The customer was then alerted that an unencrypted Sourcegraph database is a deemed by our Sourcegraph security team as a low vulnerability and should be encrypted for maximum security.
