Summary: The customer reported that after setting up GitHub SSO and visiting the login page, they were redirected to a 404 page.
    "auth.providers": [
     {
     "type": "github",
     "allowSignup": false,
     "allowOrgs": ["orgname"],
     "clientID": "
     "clientSecret": "
     }
     ],
I set up an instance with the customer's settings and everything worked fine for me. This led me to believe that there was something wrong with their GitHub App.
The customer shared a screenshot of their GitHub App and I could see that the app was set up as a regular app instead of an OAuth App. We changed the GitHub App to a GitHub OAuth App and this worked for the customer.
