Doc Update Link:
Summary: I'm setting up an external Redis host(s) for Sourcegraph on AWS ElastiCache, I don't see any cluster sizing guidance in your docs. Any recommendations?
We don't have recommendations for ElastiCache, but this is a relatively small service so the defaults in the deploy-sourcegraph repo should be enough for redis-store.
