Summary: This issue covers a request for the ability to view batch specs in the UI from users who have been removed from the Sourcegraph instance
This is a known issue, but there's a few ways to get at the data
In the graphQL console query { batchSpecs { nodes { id description { name description } originalInput } } }
In the database SELECT id,raw_spec FROM batch_specs WHERE user_id IS NULL;
