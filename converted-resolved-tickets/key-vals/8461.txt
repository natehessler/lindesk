Summary: The customer was unable to upgrade to 3.38 due to a CVE issue that was blocking this. This CVE is related to busybox vulnerabilities in some of our service images.
We tried to pull in v3.40 alpine images into the registry and tried to upgrade with 3.38.1 service images. The vulnerability was present in several other images. Hence, we had to abort and try a direct upgrade to 3.40. Here we ran into an issue where the images being pulled were still 3.38.1. This blocker halted upgrade for a while
The issue was resolved customer side with a waiver in their image signoff for 3.38 images. They're now upgraded to 3.39 in dev and planning on moving the upgrade to prod.
