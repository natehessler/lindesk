re getting user reports that the keyboard shortcuts don't work in the browser.
Summary: Tested the shortcuts in Chrome, Firefox, and Chrome on Windows and Mac.
The shortcuts for toggling the History Panel and Line Wrap were not working on Mac because alt+h and alt+z are used to create special characters instead of returning key attributes.
