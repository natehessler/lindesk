Summary: -   ZenDesk: [This one might be more helpful, maybe](https://sourcegraph.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/3958)
Batch changes were stuck in a "processing" state on the UI page.
The steps that I had conducted didn't surface too much useful information, unfortunately. But there was a lot of chatter regarding batch changes within the channel at the time, so we had deferred to getting it setup first before pursuing troubleshooting here.
Having the customer set up webhooks was the final recommendation. Since then, no more escalations in this thread.
