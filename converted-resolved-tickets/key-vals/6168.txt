Summary: Is there a way to keep the blob id or some sort of hashing mapping per file somewhere? I can think of 2 use cases, but I'm pretty sure there are more, would love to find exact duplicate files across repos. I can think of this as a more generic thing in which we could leverage on Sourcegraph to find duplicated files across repos and across directories of a same repo, to find some tech debt
I believe using the following query might be of assistance repo:contains.file($NAME_OF_FILE) and/or file:contains.content($CONTENT) .What the first query will do, is grab repos that contain a file that, say, you have a hunch that it may have duplicated files. The second query will return all the files that contain specific content that you think is duplicated. Unfortunately, this is something the product can't do right now. On a more positive note, it's in our product list of features to develop so this should be something that may be available in future iterations.
