Summary: The customer wanted to know if it's possible to work with external Postgres through a connection pooler. There is already an ongoing discussion around their external DB environment which is different from what we currently have. And I noticed that Elzanne their CE is already working with the team to write a doc around their environment and she also jumped on this request to note the ongoing work which may be likely shared today.
Can SourceGraph work with external Postgres through connection pooler (pgbouncer)?
None Answer from CE Feedback from our Delivery team is that they should be able to use pgbouncer without any issue.
