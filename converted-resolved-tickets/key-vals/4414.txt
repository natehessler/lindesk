Summary: Customer complaining of error message in the UI when putting their sourcegraph url into the browser extension: "Incorrect Sourcegraph Instance Address".
Asked for siteConfig -- Nothing suspect.
Corrected incorrect sourcegraph url -- did not fix issue but needed to be done.
Asked if they had granted extension permissions on their codehost.
These steps fixed the issue:
Navigate to any page on your code host. Right-click the Sourcegraph icon in the browser extension toolbar. Click "Enable Sourcegraph on this domain". Click "Allow" in the permissions request popup.
