Summary: The customer found that for a newly initialized instance they weren't receiving the initialize site admin signing flow
Troubleshooting steps involved checking the database to see whats going on, if we can pull any users -- none were there
On a call we then attempted to recreate the cluster since its a test cluster and has no data to be concerned about -- upon so doing we discovered that the deploy-sourcegraph repo that the customer was using had diverged from our main deployment and appeared to be missing a number of our changes in main
I also independently tested a fresh deployment of Sourcegraph in v3.37.0
After leaving the admin to correctly merge the changes from our remote branch the issue no longer persisted. Marking as closed.
