Summary: s it possible to turn off the browser & ide extension banners system-wide?
A quick question for you. Whenever you dismiss this banner, does it pop up again in subsequent searches? The reason I ask is because, typically when I've dismissed it, it hasn't shown up again. At the moment, I am double checking with my teammates if there is a way to do this because at the top of my mind I'm not aware of a configuration on Global Settings or Site Configuration that does this.
Happy to come back to you with feedback tomorrow.
I can confirm that once this banner is dismissed the logic is set up to have it not pop up again. More on this PR here.
