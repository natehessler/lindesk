Summary: Customer asking for convenience for making many parallel requests to our [Stream API](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/api/stream_api), as well as reporting 504 errors (possible rate-limits).
Currently no support for the parallelization/ergonomic nice-to-haves of a more sophisticated API experience/API UX. But what the customer is doing is basically on the money of what we recommend; write a script to fire multiple requests, have the requests return their values, and then data-massage/parse/organize the returned results to something useable for the user's needs.
Expecting the 504s issue to be reported in a different, also Atlassian issue (customer is going to be OOO so closing this ticket for now).
