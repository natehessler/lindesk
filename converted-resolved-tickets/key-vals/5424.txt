Summary: There seems to be something happening where symbols are showing up as 'unknown' causing the select:symbol.class to fail because the class is not recognized as a class.
I have been testing on this repo https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-jetbrains/-/blob/src/main/java/Util.java?L9:14-9:18 I added the repo to a new docker-compose instance on sourcegraph version 3.31.2 and 3.33.0 For example the class Util shows up as 'class' on 3.31.2 and 'unknown' on version 3.33.0 I indexed the repo with lsif-java on sourcegraph 3.33.0 and the symbol showed up as 'unknown' still.
This seems to be a bug that should be fixed with https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/29903
