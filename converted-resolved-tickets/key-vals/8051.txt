Summary: ​Is there a way to block access to recent searches on the Sourcegraph home screen?  It has come to our attention that if you do a search for something potentially sensitive, we don't want to show that search result to every user of Sourcegraph.
​The behavior of our recent searches is that they are only visible to the user who performed the said search. For example, Dev A performs a vulnerable search and it appears on their Sourcegraph homepage. Dev B logs into Sourcegraph and does not see the vulnerable search from Dev A in their recent searches. Dev B only sees the searches that they have performed on Sourcegraph. The only way that Dev A and Dev B would see the same recent searches as if they were sharing one account with the same credentials. ​
