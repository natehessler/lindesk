Summary: ​The customer attempted to use sudo-level access token permissions to set repository permissions for their Sourcegrph instance and received the following error. ​ Did not find authentication provider matching type openidconnect and configID rms-plusplus-sourcegraph. Check the site configuration to verify that an entry in auth.providers matches the type and configID.
​After a customer call with SWE Asdine El Hrychy and CE Leo Abreu, it was discovered that theconfigID field was missing from the customer's openID auth provider.
