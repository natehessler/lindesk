Summary: Customer was seeing "Processing symbols is taking longer than expected. Try again in a while" in the symbols sidebar. Wanted to know if this indicates a configuration issue or if C++ processing is just slow
Based on our docs, this is the result of gitserver or symbols being underprovisioned. I recommended that more resources be allocated here.
