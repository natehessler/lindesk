Summary: Any ideas why this query: file:pom.xml \
Used the customer's query on cse-k8s and this returned null results. I tried reducing the scope of the query and was able to create an insight for just one repo. The customer reported that this was for 12k repos which was huge. I couldn't reproduce this without breaking with our instance.
I thought that the best way was to request the customer to up the resources on the frontend in order to process this.
But this was corrected by Joel Kwartler via DM that this query is actually a bug that affects queries across thousands of repos. 12k repos would take a day or thereabouts.
Here is the fixed bug: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/30071 and it will be available in v3.37
