Summary: We are doing work to remediate CVE-2021-44228 (which is related to the Java log4j library) and wanted to confirm if any of the containers that run as part of Sourcegraph are Java-based?
No, none of the containers that make up sourcegraph are java based.
Checked all relevant repos for java language
