Summary: In the Kubernetes gitserver deployment port 1378 has been exposed. Do we need port 6060? What is port 6060 for?
The deployment for sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph is configured to run as is. The exposure of the 6060 port is specific to Docker configurations. Port 6060 is for Prometheus metrics. ​ ​
