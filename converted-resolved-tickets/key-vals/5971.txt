Summary: The customer wanted to find out how to disable their GitHub auth and not their code host.
Can anyone tell me in which table in postgres container, we are saving a informaion for Github auth? sorry, my goal is to remove this entry from DB side
The screenshot you shared above is for code host config and permission. It's different from Github Auth. GitHub Auth is done on site configuration, find the reference here, and can be removed from site config too.
You don't have to do that from the DB if you can't access it from the UI, you can edit the site-config using your terminal following this doc or run either of these commands: kubectl exec -it \$FRONTEND_POD -- sh -c 'apk add --no-cache nano && nano \~/site-config.json'
Or if you prefer using a Vim editor: kubectl exec -it \$FRONTEND_POD -- sh -c 'vi \~/site-config.json'
