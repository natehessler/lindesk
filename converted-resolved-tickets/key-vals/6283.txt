title: Issues Testing Upgrade / Downgrade to v3.35: Unhealthy container error when downgrading
Application engineer: Riana Shahid

Summary: Customer recently upgraded and then as a test, wanted to try downgrading in the event of any errors when upgrading in the future. They got an error saying their frontend container is unhealthy
    ERROR: for sourcegraph-frontend-0  Container "{localdocker name}" is unhealthy.
    ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
    [root@XXXXXXXXXX docker-compose]
I first recommended that they try restarting the container to see if that clears the error. This did not work but overnight the customer cleared the error themselves by going back to the upgraded version. I let them know that presently, downgrading is not recommended because it's prone to errors like the one they got but a future release of sourcegraph should make the process easier. The customer initially downgraded as a way to recover if anything went wrong during an upgrade. I recommended that they have a backup and work from there in the future instead of downgrading their instance.
