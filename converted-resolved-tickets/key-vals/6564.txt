Summary: ​Hi there! Do you maintain your IDE extensions, or are those community maintained? ​ ​It seems like the "copy link to file" doesn't work with our managed instance. Instead of navigating to tinder.sourcegraph.com it goes to just sourcegraph.com and cannot find our repos.
​I was just in the middle of trying \[this\] out for you before I suggested them to you. But if you haven't tried them yet I'm very positive this should fix your issue. ​ ​
