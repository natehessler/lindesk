Doc Update Link:
Summary: The customer reported that they were seeing receiving different results on code insights graph for 2 similar queries. The first code insight was generated 6 months ago as compared to a newer one a few weeks old.
Try to find if the search query used had a repo: filter. If not, include it and see how the results stack up.
Unfortunately, the customer hasn't gotten back to me in 4 days+. Closing this and will re-open if and when they do.
