Summary: A customer hoping to use the Sourcegraph IntelliJ plugin wanted to know how to configure the plugin to reference a Sourcegraph instance other than Sourcegraph.com
Hey Wolf,
I've done a little investigation and setup on my end and I'm not sure it will be necessary to open up a thread in our
In order to point the IntelliJ at a private Sourcegraph instance, you'll need to create a .sourcegraph-jetbrains.properties in your home directory Ex: url = https://cse-k8s.sgdev.org/
Above I've configured the instance to target a test deployment for our team, and the plugin is opening files in my Sourcegraph test instance.
You can also find more information in the extensions Readme -- https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-jetbrains/-/blob/README.md
It's possible that your team may need to use remoteUrlReplacement option to target your Source monorepo, let me know if you run into any troubles there.
I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any follow-up questions.
