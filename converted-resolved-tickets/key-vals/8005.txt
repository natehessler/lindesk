Summary: > Heya sourcegraph!  Is there a way to apply a filter to exclude commented-out lines with the language-specific plugins available?  Can I say tell it to search and exclude comment sections for say java?
We don't currently have a way to filter out comments across the board, but symbol search will match declarations and ignore plaintext. If you know that the search term you're looking for is in a string, you can use structural search to find wherever it appears within quotes.
