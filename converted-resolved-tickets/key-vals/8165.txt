Summary: When a batch spec is applied on an archived repo and it gets stuck with the error message 
If the changesets in the batch changes are still Open then there is a likely chance that some of the PR hasnt been merged in the codehost, the status of the changeset would changed from open to merged if the PR has been approved and merged in the codehost. From a test I did on my end, if the changeset for the archived repos are in a failed state and other changesets have been merged. You can go ahead to close the batch change.Further Explanation on the status of a batch change and the changesets it creates. In the Batch changes status we have only 3 filters \[ Open, Closed, Merged \]When you click on a Batch change, you see multiple changesets having different status filter \[unpublished, Failed, Retrying, Merged, Deleted ... etc \]. It shows the status for each changesets in a batch change. However, when the other changesets are merged and one is failing becaue its for an archived repo, the status of the batch changes would be open. so when you are certain all the changesets are merged. You can now manually close it.
