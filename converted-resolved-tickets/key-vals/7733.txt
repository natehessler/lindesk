Summary: The customer discovered a bug in Sourcegraph's Markdown renderer in which a bullet prefixed with "0" in Markdown is rendered by Sourcegraph as a "1".
Navigate to a specific line within a Markdown file with a numbered list that begins with "0". Open the Markdown file as a whole within Sourcegraph and examine that the line renders as a numbered list that begins with "1" instead. ​
The bug was submitted to our public issue tracker.
