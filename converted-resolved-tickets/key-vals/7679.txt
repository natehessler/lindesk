I looked at logs from the worker found the following errors: - I see alot of 
-   I didn't see any  OOM error or anything to indicate that the worker is under-provisioned on this container to warrant increasing the memory.
Nothing in the logs is confirming that the worker in under-provisioned. My suspicion here is this alerts is firing because of the noisy (but harmless) error messages in v3.38.0.
Just some follow up questions; - the alert only fired once in the span of an hour (1900-2000hrs) all through yesterday and resolved itself?
