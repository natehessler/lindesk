Summary: Customer wanted to know if sourcegraph supports all Comby features. Linked this 40 minute youtube video going over some features.
I did not watch the video but overall, Comby is supported. I asked them to clarify if they had a specific feature in mind so that I could confirm but I did not get a response, so it's safe to close this.
