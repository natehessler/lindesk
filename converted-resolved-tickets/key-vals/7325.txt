Summary: GitLab SSO Auth isn't working and users are only provided with builtin password auth. As it stands, no auth via GitLab and as well as builtin.
I requested for customer frontend logs to see if any auth errors were being thrown. A customer user mentioned that there was a GitLab event last week(3/28 - 4/1). This could be related to this https://twitter.com/gitlabstatus/status/1510699550347984896?s=20&t=paA9nQEoFN4-lp-pIX-TwQ. In addition, the customer tagged a user who I believe is on the infrastructure team since a mention of cluster rebuild was mentioned.
In this case, I am of very little assistance since the customer issue here is more internal as far as Sourcegraph is concerned. Closing this issue based on this.
