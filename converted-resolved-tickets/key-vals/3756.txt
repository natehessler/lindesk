Summary: Customer cannot search an internal repo.
-   No troubleshooting is required from CSE, this is a known issue and the site admin at glovo told the user the worked around to it..
-   Orgs members cannot search for internal repos on Sourcegraph if they are not direct members of those internal repos. The workaround is the user needs to be added as a member of the internal repo. Afterwards, you can now see the repo on SG.
