Summary: Hi, how do I find all the \*.hcl which don't have namespace property defined?
(the -content:namespace will omit any repos containing the pattern namespace -- you can see an example here with the content:namespace where it returns things like add_lease_metrics_namespace_labels, to really get all the correct repos we may need to make the -content: field a little more specific to the pattern in an .hcl file)
