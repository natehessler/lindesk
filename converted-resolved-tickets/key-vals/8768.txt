Summary: "Now that I'm about ready to launch this thing, I have a question about the published state. I know I can apply via either the CLI tool or through the UI but am curious whether I can publish via the UI at some point too, or whether that is to be done only via a change in the specfile?" ​
​Yes. You are able to publish your batch change from the UI as well.
The process to do so is described here. ​
