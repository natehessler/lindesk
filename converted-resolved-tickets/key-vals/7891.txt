Summary: > hello Sourcegraph folks! I had an interesting question come up and thought I'd ask you for input:
>
> 
>
> I am curious what your recommendations are and if you know why the search-export would produce differing results
> The reason you see different result numbers is because the UI makes use of our [Stream API](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/api/stream_api), while the search export extension uses our internal GraphQL API. To optimize speed, the GraphQL API has a cap of 30 results, but you can override that with an exhaustive search.
