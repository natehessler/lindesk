Summary: The customer reported that several repos stopped updating for days at a time on two separate instances about a month apart. After retrieving logs and a multitude of troubleshooting a root cause could not be determined.
Enhanced gitserver logging was added by SWE Asdine El Hrychy and made available in Sourcegraph v 3.36.0.
The customer has also planned an effort to create a script to alert them when repo updates fall behind.
The customer has also been instructed to reach out again should the error return.
