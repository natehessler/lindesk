Summary: ​Hi Team, can we add this repo to sourcegraph instance? https://github.com/nutanix/l2gw-mgr
​Hello @sriram!This is something that can be handled by your Sourcegraph admin @ankit.khandelwal using the following information. If you or anyone else on your team has Site Admin access to your Sourcegraph instance they should be able to facilitate that request as well.
