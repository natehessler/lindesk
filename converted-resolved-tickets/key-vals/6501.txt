After looking at this a little more, I believe whats going on here is that there were some lsif uploads being processed, and migrator was holding on those before completing, so having stopped those should be fine.I believe the intended use of migrator is to effectively run migrations before an upgrade, but I'm not sure doing this would have gotten around these codeintel uploads processing and creating some downtime, from our docs -- In some situations, administrators may wish to migrate their databases before upgrading the rest of the system to reduce downtime. Sourcegraph guarantees database backward compatibility to the most recent minor point release so the database can safely be upgraded before the application code.To execute the database migrations independently, follow the Kubernetes instructions on how to manually run database migrations. Running the up (default) command on the migrator of the version you are upgrading to will apply all migrations required by the next version of Sourcegraph.
The interaction with codeintel uploads might be in need of some ergonomics upgrades here. I'll reach out to our team and to check some of my assumptions here and provide some feedback

Hey @jmeador just wanted to check back in on this -- TL;DR the above information is correct, these logs were just letting you know that index creation was waiting for lsif uploads to finish processing.Also wanted to get some clarity on this -- the effect here was that those stalled queries were blocking migrator from completing, so it required manual intervention to get the upgrade completed
Was there any downtime for users during the upgrade? It shouldn't be the case that concurrent index creation actually blocks writes to the database
