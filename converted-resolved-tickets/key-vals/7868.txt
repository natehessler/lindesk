Summary: The customer found that repos were cloning and updating fine but noticed that the repos hadn't been indexed for 2 months
Check out logs from the zoekt services as well as gitserver. Also take a look at grafana charts
It turned out that during a previous upgrade the admin had neglected to upgrade the version of the indexed search pods, correcting this error resolved this.
