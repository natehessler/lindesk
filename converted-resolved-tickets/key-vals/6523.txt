Summary: We have a monorepo (https://source.corp.lookout.com/services/conservice) that isn't getting picked up by SG due to it's size. (this was not the actual problem - he was guessing based on a previous case)
What I did:
A. One repo was not coming up in search
B. Confirmed that the user was a Site Admin because by default they can see all repos added. Asked him to go to the repositories admin page
C. Yes it was there
D. Therefore looked closer at the search he was running - was it getting what he wanted?
E. Had him include fork:yes that worked to show the repo
F. He realized that its awkward for them and apparently has something to do with the 'network root' (he had more context than me given I cannot see his repos)
G. He said "once services/conservice (the repos name) is the root, then you wouldn't have to specify forks...  But github doesn't make it as easy to change network root anymore, i think"
H. So the solution was either E. or G.
