Summary: When I try to activate sourcegraph extension (using the private instance user option) with sourcegraph instance URL https://sg-instance.com/. It gives the output: Unable to verify your access token for https://sg.instance.com/. Please try again with a new access token.
Can you try adding the token and url to the json config?\
Navigate to Code , Preferences, then click Settings.\
Search for Sourcegraph.\
Add these settings:
    "sourcegraph.url": "https://sg.instance.com/",
    "sourcegraph.accessToken": "
    "sourcegraph.basePath": "/home/
