Summary: Is it possible to use GitHub App to allow sourcegraph access to your  organization / private repos.
At the moment, it is not possible to use a GitHub App. This is an effort underway right now and hopefully this would be available soon. Today, users can either: - Connect with GitHub and add repos as an individual through OAuth - Create an organization (in the limited access) and use connect with GitHub with a PAT, where the PAT belongs to themselves or machine account
