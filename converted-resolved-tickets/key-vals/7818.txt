Summary: The customer was trying to get sourcegraph chrome extension to work on our code repo. It appears that sg has full access to our git enterprise but I don't see any code intelligence pop up when I hover within our codebase.
-   Can you confirm on your Sourcegraph instance if the programming language extensions are enabled.
-   is this repo cloned and searchable on your Sourcegraph instance and are you able to get code intel on this repo in Sourcegraph?
-   In addition to the above, In the [documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension) on the extension, there is a section for \[troubleshooting\](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension
The problem auto resolved itself after the user signed out and signed back in
