Doc Update Link:
Summary: This is a managed instance problem which folks on delivery noted that there were some alerts, they noticed in their logs that many repos are blocked by SSO.
This was open to delivery looking into the SSO permissions of repos. The customer reported that they added several GH orgs and forgot the auth token.
They updated the token to SSO with all new orgs added.
