Summary: Customer attempted to run a Batch Change with src cli and encountered an error, reporting that no searcher endpoints could be found.
I asked the customer for the current number of searcher replicas and repos in their current deployment. They didn't have access to that information, and tagged in a teammate who would. Unfortunately, the teammate never responded.
The customer attempted the Batch Change again later in the day, and it worked just fine. There have been no further issues, so I shared the docs page about scaling a Kubernetes deployment in case this resurfaces.
