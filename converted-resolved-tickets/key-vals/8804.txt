Summary: Ultimately, the customer was having trouble configuring SSO with OneLogin.
Sourcegraph expects certain case-sensitive parameters, and they were providing them in TitleCase, which is different from what sourcegraph wants. After fixing this, they started getting 500 errors, which ended up being an issue with redis-store container being unhealthy.
