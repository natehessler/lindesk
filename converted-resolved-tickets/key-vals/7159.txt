Summary: OBSERVATION: VS Code Extension can be used to search sourcegraph from directly within VS Code. As part of the UX, clicking on the search-results of a sourcegraph search will open up the file into VS Code, but only in read-only mode.
QUESTION: Can VS Code Extension open these files locally, instead i.e. smartly match the search result to a local copy of the file on disk?
No, not yet. But it's a [feature request](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/32633)!
