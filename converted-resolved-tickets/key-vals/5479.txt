Summary: Customer upgraded Sourcegraph from 3.31.0 to 3.34.2 just before the holidays.  Since then, Sourcegraph is unable to connect to Perforce branches.  When verifying the mirroring connection in settings for a repo, the following error is reported:
gitserver error (status code 500): unmarshal JSON: ReadVal: can only unmarshal into pointer, error found in
Created an issue almost immediately as this seemed to be an encoding issue with Golang unmarshalling.
This was fixed in 3.35.0, so I asked the customer to upgrade to that version, which fixed the issue.
