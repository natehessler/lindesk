Summary: Customer noticed a large increase in disk space over the past few days.
Asked for container usage statistics from the customer and noticed that the symbols service was sitting at 256G of usage which was too high.
Found a thread from earlier in the customer-support-internal channel pointing to an issue with the symbols service not deleting old cache files, which filled the disk quicker than usual. I informed the customer that this was the case and that a patch was forthcoming.
