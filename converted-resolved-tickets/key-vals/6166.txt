Summary: The customer initially had a question on how to setup src cli since it was failing to login after providing env variables. The login would get stuck.
Create a new token and echo \$SRC_ENDPOINT and \$SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN to ensure that everything is correct.
The customer found out that the root cause of src login getting stuck was that they had overridden src with another command and would get stuck because it was waiting for input. Renaming to src-cli fixed the issue.
