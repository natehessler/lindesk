Summary: Netflix is planning to deprecate one of their internal libraries, but in order to do so, they want to extract the components that receive regular use. The request here was to craft a query that would allow them to do so.
-   Craft a query that searches Netflix's entire codebase for components in this library, without actually searching that particular library.
    -   
-   Install 
-   Run query and redirect output to txt file.
    -   
-   Cat the raw results file and grep "import"
    -   
-   Final result:
    103 
    104 
    105 
    106 
    107 
    etc. etc.
