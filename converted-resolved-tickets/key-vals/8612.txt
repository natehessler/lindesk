Summary: The customer is getting a '404 Not Found' page when they click the 'Raw download file' button.
Tested this on 3.38 and saw the same behavior as the customer.
This bug was introduced in 3.37 and fixed in 3.40. There is a workaround that works by opening the download link in a new tab. https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/33888
