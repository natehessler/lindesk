Summary: Why can't I use Structural search with yml files? I don't get the results I expect?!?!
The reason is because structural search uses Comby and is designed for other languages like Go, Java, JSON, etc That's why it doesn't work quite the same with Yaml / Yml files: Sourcegraph structural search.
> Matching blocks in indentation-sensitive languages. It's not currently possible to match blocks of code that are indentation-sensitive. This is a feature planned for future work.
