 use this yaml file to configure the git server. I see in the documentation that I also need to rewrite the override.yaml file. Which command should I re-apply the overrride.yaml file? Will the whole sourcegraph server restart if I re-apply the override.yaml file?
will need to add the gitserver section to your override file. The command to apply the new override to the existing cluster is upgrade with the same options as the install command, you ran previously: so helm upgrade -f override.yaml sg sourcegraph/sourcegraphand the namespace you used.
 the services changed by the override file should restart, though Helm won't restart the pods if the changes involve secrets. You will need to do a manual restart of gitserver to make sure the container with the secret is running. kubectl rollout restart sts  gitserver
Summary:     gitserver:
