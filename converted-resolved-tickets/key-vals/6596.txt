Summary: Why is Sourcegraph specific with language in regards to lsif uploads? (admin trying to develop indexer for in house languages)
Many engineers jumped in to help answer this one
:wave::skin-tone-2: The spec is not language specific, but reading input source and producing values that conform to the spec require things like type checking and symbol resolution (need to jump to def from a use to a definition - you need to be able to resolve the variable and its uses).Note that LSIF dumps also contain information that will eventually allow us to resolve things like Find implementations and Go to type definition.

Related, we have an open PR that adds new configuration to remap syntax highlighting for file extensions. For example, that would allow site admins to configure Scala syntax highlighting for \*.strato file.
