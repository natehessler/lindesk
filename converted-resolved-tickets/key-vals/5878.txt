Summary: Is there a way to configure SAML response to inform Sourcegraph of who is/isn't an Admin? Otherwise, is there a way to force make someone an Admin via a manual Postgres query?
Also, while you're at it, is there a way to generate site-admin:sudo tokens that aren't associated to a specific user?
Hey @ajacobs I had a chance to do some looking into both configuring SAML login to register a user as a site admin, and I'm afraid I'm going to be the bearer of bad newsFor Okta SAML login it looks like from the Okta side this should be possible, but Sourcegraph isn't yet able to process this sort of setupAs for generating a Sourcegraph access token that isn't associated to a user account I'm afraid thats not possible at the moment either, you can see from our database that the creator_user_id and subject_user_id fields are required on a token sg=
