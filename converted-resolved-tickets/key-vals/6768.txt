title: /15/2022 Update Still waiting to hear back from the customer, but have gently nudged them again this morning. Not really expecting to hear anything today, thanks to the time zone difference. Drafting up the case summary now on the assumption that everything's going to come back green. Because what's life without a little hubris.

Summary: -   Doc Update Link: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/32629
Customer reported a large JSON file not appearing in search results as expected, despite having added the largeFiles tag in their site configuration. When I asked how, specifically, they had set that configuration up, they sent me this: "search.largeFiles": \[ "\*\*.json"\]
I replicated the issue by creating an indexing a dummy repo with JSON files of various sizes on different levels, and set up my site config to match the customer's. Large files on the root level were indexed and searchable, but anything nested was ignored. I experimented with indexing large nested files by including direct paths, which worked, and from there was able to extrapolate that there was some confusion stemming from the layout of the [search details page](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/explanations/search_details). I have opened up a PR to clarify the difference in syntax between site configuration and the .sourcegraph/ignore file.
I informed the customer of the correct syntax to index large nested files, as well as pointing out that if this is the only large file they want to make sure is searchable, including the direct path from root in site config would take care of it. There has been no further communication despite multiple followup inquiries, so I am considering this resolved.
