Doc Update Link:
Summary: The customer reported that many repos had not been synching for weeks, zoekt-indexserver logs indicated failure to shut down processes in the go automation of indexing processes
remove the repo and re-add restart the zoekt-indexserver (worked in our case test instance but not in customer single container) look for "poison pill" repo to remove
This issue was only resolved after upgrading from v3.30.3 to v3.31.2 I'm unable to gather more info from the customer but it is suspected that the single-container instance was resource constrained and upgrading rolled in many CPU and mem performance improvements that ultimately resolved this issue for the customer.
