Summary: This initially started as a How to, with the customer asking how to properly index a repo.
Checked the queue in pgsql for the repo in question, which wasn't there. confirming that the repo was never set to index in the first place. Determined that while a private repo, several other private/internal repos were indexing. Tried manually adding the repo in question to the code host config. Repo still not showing up.
They had a generic github user that needed read permissions to the repo.
