tion on batch changes. Is there a concept of multi commit change? basically a way to commit in between run steps?
 not possible to run multiple commits in one batch change. What Batch Changes does is:\
rate the diff locally,\
Summary: Send it to the Sourcegraph instance,\
then, the Sourcegraph instance creates a commit and uses the configured credentials to push it to a branch and open a changeset.
