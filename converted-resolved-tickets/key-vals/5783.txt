Summary: The customer noted that one of their repos index was lagging behind for 12 days.
This didn't require any troubleshooting steps as it's an issue that kept re-occuring.
The site admin performed a version upgrade to latest for their Sourcegraph instance and this made the repo get re-indexed during the weekend.
