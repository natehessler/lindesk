Summary: The customer stopped seeing code intel popups.
We checked the symbols pod to make sure it was running. We confirmed the symbols server was running by running curl on localhost in the symbols container.
    / 
    404 page not found
We ran this HTTP request with query parameters for the symbols server.
    curl -sS localhost:3184/search --data '{"repo":"github.com/gorilla/mux","commitID":"3cf0d013e53d62a96c096366d300c84489c26dd5","Query":"Route","IsRegExp":false,"IsCaseSensitive":false,"IncludePatterns":[""],"ExcludePattern":"","First":2}'
We checked the console for errors and the network tab for CodeIntelSearch requests. We didn't see any requests for the code intel hovers or errors in the console.
The customer unknowingly disabled the code intel extensions as part of their security review. We sent them the list of code intel extensions to add to allowRemoteExtensions and this fixed the issue.
    "extensions": { "allowRemoteExtensions": [
       "sourcegraph/datadog-metrics",
       "sourcegraph/code-ownership",
       "sourcegraph/search-export",
       "sourcegraph/git-extras",
        ]
      },
