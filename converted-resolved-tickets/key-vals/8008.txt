Summary: -   permissions sync not functioning, users have no access to private repositories
-   This customer is using groupsCachedPermissions sync. This feature expects a PAT with access to all user orgs, but we've seen that this is not available for all customers due to various GitHub Enterprise versions and deployments. This customer could only scope their PAT to a specific org, which raised 404 errors when we tried to access teams outside the authed org.
-   We resolved this bug in version 3.40. The customer upgraded and now reports that all users have expected permissions
