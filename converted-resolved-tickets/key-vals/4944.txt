Summary: Twitter's monorepo began to fail to index. This first manifested as the lsif CI pipeline starting to fail. The zoekt index became out of date.
Check logs for the indexserver
This issue was resolved by the allocation of more resources to the gitserver as well as the implementation of many improvements to git (the .gitconfig) in both gitserver and zoekt-indexserver. These additions were primarily integrated into Sourcegraph main, but one environment variable was used to eliminate egress throttling SRC_GIT_SERVICE_MAX_EGRESS_BYTES_PER_SECOND
