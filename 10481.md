## Summary
### Customer Question
​
​My `src lsif upload` is failing because it says the upstream repo does not exist:
[2022-08-17T18:11:45.773Z] [2022-08-17T18:11:45.773Z] unexpected status code: 404 (failed to enqueue payload: unknown repository "gitent.corp.nuro.team/Nuro-ai/Nuro/")
But when I look in the instance itself it is definitely there since https://sg.corp.nuro.team/gitent.corp.nuro.team/Nuro-ai/Nuro is a valid URL and brings me to the repo I expect
