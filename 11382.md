## Summary
### Customer Question
Hey @Kevin Quigley, @Jake Snow just messaged me with a Sourcegraph question. He‚Äôs wondering if Sourcegraph should be/could be providing code intelligence for Python code, because we‚Äôre not seeing that at the moment. Are we perhaps missing this extension from our installation? https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-python
‚Äã
### Application Engineer Answer
‚Äã
‚ÄãI‚Äôll chime in here.
Sourcegraph can provide code intelligence for the Python Code using the SCIP Python tool.
Here is the github repo for the project.
The extension you linked in your post is not the officially supported method for Python code intelligence, and support for it within Sourcegraph is being deprecated.
Please let me know if you have any other follow-up questions.

Thanks, Alex! Hi Jake, nice to meet you üëãüèª I‚Äôll add that this will be auto-indexed for you with a managed instance (what we‚Äôre exploring with your team now). Other languages will too including Ruby, Rust, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript. Check out the full context here on our release last week: https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/release/4.0#code-intelligence-uplevel-your-code-search
