## Summary
### Customer Question
We've recently brought our Sourcegraph back online after Kubernetes cluster issues by restoring codeintel-db and pgsql volumes per https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/migrate-backup#persistent-data-backup-in-kubernetes.From that doc I was hoping that Insights would spring to life too but none of the previous Insights are showing. Are there steps to take, or should we be restoring the volume for codeinsight-db?
### Application Engineer Answer
To get back your old insights, re-attaching the previous PVC for should be able to do the trick.
