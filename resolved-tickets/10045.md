## Summary
### Customer Question
I can't log in to my instance because I set up SSO wrong. How do I access the site-admin file if I cannot log in to the instance?

### Application Engineer Answer
You can change the site-admin by exec'ing into the pgsql shell and using the database to do so. You can also do so by changing site-config.json in the deployment.
