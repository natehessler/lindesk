## Summary

### Customer Question
Hi! do you know if there's a chance to re-open a sourcegraph campaign that we closed by accident? We don't seem to find any methods for that on the UI


### Application Engineer Answer
Hello Alex, unfortunately, once a campaign/batch change is closed, it can’t be updated or reopened anymore.
