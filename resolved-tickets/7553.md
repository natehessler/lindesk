## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer was seeing a repeated `meta:signal: killed` error within `gitserver` while attempting to clone a large repository.

### Application Engineer Answer
> You can use repositories that are already cloned to disk on the host machine to speed up Sourcegraphâ€™s cloning. This is useful for very large repositories on which cloning exceeds the resources available to the Docker container.
