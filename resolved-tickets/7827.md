## Summary
### Customer Question
Also, in regards to the above screenshot, another thing I see is that enabling alerts starts to show the yellow banner with “observability.alerts and observability.silenceAlerts” still stays there. Do we need to do any other configuration changes?
### Application Engineer Answer
We can add the following flag to the docker manifest

-e PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:9090
The docker run command will then be:
docker run --publish 7080:7080 --publish 127.0.0.1:3370:3370 --rm --volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph -e PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:9090 sourcegraph/server:3.39.0


Long term fix here: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/34597
