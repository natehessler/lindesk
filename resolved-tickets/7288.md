## Summary
### Customer Question
This customer had a few questions:
1. How do I get all given repos that have a certain string?
2. Can I get this data in a more consumable format like json or csv?
3. Is there also an API that I could get a json response from?

### Application Engineer Answer
1. Yup. Use the select filter, like this: `select:repo java.net.preferIPv4Stack`
2. Yes! On the `src` cli there is a `-json` tag that will return search results in `json` format.
3. You betcha!!! There's two options here:
    * Go to your settings on the web app. In the left menu there is an API console under the `other actions` heading where you can run `graphql` queries.
    * The `src` cli has a command `src api` which you can run `graphql` queries through.
