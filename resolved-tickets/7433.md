## Summary
### Customer Question
We are currently using SSO with Okta for Sourcegraph, but we have to manually remove users that are off-boarded (to avoid consuming licenses for people that can't actually use them). I'd like to know if Sourcegraph supports https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/scim/SCIM>, is that the case? I've been doing some research and can't find any information online.
### Application Engineer Answer
No, we don't have support for a SCIM API, but we will sync access controls from the code host. Users can be removed using our graphQL API. Would be intuitive to run this as a cron to periodically remove users.
