## Summary
### Customer Question
How do you change named volume path in your docker-compose.yml file?
I understand that i can change by use long syntax of docker named volume,  but that's required docker file 3.2,  but i just noticed your compose file is v2.4 and I'm too afraid to change that version number.
Basically, i just want to change gitserver and indexed-search volume to my /app/ as mention earlier,  but i don't know how to easily do it.

### Application Engineer Answer
I'm sorry if I've confused you here and I believe you are spot on of your understanding of volumes here.
I think I was slightly off queue here and got it jumbled up the other way round :sweat_smile:
In the example you've shared, this is where compose mounts the zoekt volume that hosts the index data. And the data will be stored in /data/index/  which when we inspect , looks something like:
"Mountpoint": "/mnt/docker-data/volumes/docker-compose_zoekt-0-shared/_data",
Thanks for spotting that
