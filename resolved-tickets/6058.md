## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Batch change throws an error when a customer tries to publish changes.
 
### Troubleshooting Steps
- Did Some research and saw some similar issues experienced.
- I asked the customer to try and clone  a repo inside the gitserver. The customer confirmed he was getting the same error. but it worked with  `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true` git clone <repo>.
- Created a GitHub issue because I understood this is not a batch change-specific problem.
- After much investigation, it was discovered that the TLS configuration is ignored when invoking git from createCommitFromPatch
- This turned out to be a bug
 
### Resolution
- This bug has been fixed in the new version of sourcegraph.Customer needs to upgrade an try again.
