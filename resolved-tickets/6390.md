## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
User wants to be able to use sed instead of find to improve performance.
 
### Toubleshooting Steps
Please see slack thread.
 
### Resolution
Ultimately, user figured this out themselves. They were doing something so customized, that it caused them a lot of pain and created a situation where we couldn't help them much. That said, the slack thread is relevant for anyone who wants to see a customer struggling through changing an already working script.
