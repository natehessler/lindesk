## Summary
### Customer Question
Where is usage statistics data stored? After migration from an old cluster to a new one, this data is missing.
### Application Engineer Answer
Usage statistics are stored in redis, specifically redis-store which has it's own PVC. Usage data doesn't persist when the instance is moved to a different cluster.
