## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Customer upgraded Sourcegraph from 3.31.0 to 3.34.2 just before the holidays.  Since then, Sourcegraph is unable to connect to Perforce branches.  When verifying the mirroring connection in settings for a repo, the following error is reported:

gitserver error (status code 500): unmarshal JSON: ReadVal: can only unmarshal into pointer, error found in #0 byte of ...|{"depots":|..., bigger context ...|{"depots":["//depot/maint/bigip16.0.1.1/","//depot|...

### Troubleshooting Steps
Created an issue almost immediately as this seemed to be an encoding issue with Golang unmarshalling.

### Resolution
This was fixed in 3.35.0, so I asked the customer to upgrade to that version, which fixed the issue.
