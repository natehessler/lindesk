## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

Customer is experiencing slow or completely stalled batch change resolutions

### Troubleshooting Steps

- Ask for logs and Grafana dashboard screenshots from a variety of services [See GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/534)
- Resolve that there is a performance issue caused by underprovisioning
- Also, know that MeLi has not been able to enable webhooks on their instance due to internal infrastructure requirements.  [See Tech Design Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13wiXeBkjO3Z0-nqi2eDDOI3jbwk15ZpL2kY0prfGm2g/edit#heading=h.li8wi35ewdix)
- Resolve that this combination of issues would cause widespread batch change resolution issues
- Customer's trial is about to end, so they are happy to trust that our recommendations would resolve the issue instead of implementing them immediately



### Resolution
These recommendations were made to the customer, who plans to implement them in 1-2 months when they create their prodution instance
