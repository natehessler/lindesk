## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue

Roblox engineers opened a batch preview which resulted in heavy database load as well as freezing batch changes UI

### Troubleshooting Steps

Gather logs from the DB as well as transaction logs from the pgsql database via the pg_stat_activity table which tracks transactions with the database

### Resolution

A meeting was held with Malo to surface lissues with the workflow Roblox was using to open previews and discuss a way to prevent users from opening terribly large batch change specs

A PR was opened to improve efficiency of the batches UI to prevent further timeout and drag: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/35501
