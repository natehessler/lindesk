## Summary

### Customer Question



How can you add another private repo to sourcegraph cloud. Customer added GitHub, but wanted to add a 2nd GitHub account.


### Application Engineer Answer



This is a limitation of Sourcegraph Cloud. You can add one GitHub account, but cannot add more because users there have no access to Site-admin. This is what it looks like in the UI:
