## Summary
### Customer Question
Is it possible to pass in DNS configs to a docker container running batch changes? We have a few resources that are only accessible behind an internal DNS and it's causing the batch changes to fail

### Application Engineer Answer
By default, a container inherits the DNS settings of the host, as defined in the /etc/resolv.conf configuration file. Custom hosts defined in /etc/hosts are not inherited. Adding the DNS to the Docker Daemon / Docker Engine should pass in the correct DNS config to the containers.
