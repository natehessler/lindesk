## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue

The Customer tried to apply a pretty simple batch change to ~10 repositories, all it's doing is updating an npm package using npm install `package-name@latest`.
When running the batch change against all the repositories at once, they would all error I ended up having to add the repositories in groups of 2/3 in order for them to pass. Is there a way to get a more verbose output from the batch change run? It's hard to debug any further using the streaming output condensed to one line.

### Troubleshooting Steps
Are you running into the error in the UI or on the CLI? If you're using  `src batch preview` or `src batch apply` you can add a -v flag to get verbose output. Eg: `src batch preview -f <batch_spec>.yml -v`. You could also try to add `-keep-logs` to retain the logs after the execution steps. If you're ever wondering about other flags/ usage you can use src batch [command] -h or visit this [documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/cli/references/batch/preview)

### Resolution
The customer was unable to reproduce the error and confirmed everything is now working as expected.
