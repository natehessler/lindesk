## Summary
### Customer Question
> ServiceNow has an enterprise trial instance deployed, and they're having trouble searching specific files in a few indexed repositories.
>
> Some of these files are under the 1mb file size limit. The issue persists even when `search.largeFiles` is  added to  the configuration property. 


### Application Engineer Answer
Files may be skipped during indexing even if they are under 1MB if they have too many unique trigrams. This can be accounted for in large file search configuration by including glob patterns to catch files nested below the root repository - though an upcoming release should simplify that setup considerably by supportive recursive globs.
