## Summary
### Customer Question
I'm looking to use Sourcegraph to get the most popular language used for a given repo.

### Application Engineer Answer
You can create an Insight to show a breakdown of the languages used in a repo. Or if you need the data in JSON you can run this query in the API console.

```
query LangStatsInsightContent($query: String!) {
    search(query: $query) {
        results {
            limitHit
        }
        stats {
            languages {
                name
                totalLines
            }
        }
    }
}

{"query": "repo:^github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph"}
```
