## Summary
### Customer Question
Hi, i'm trying to create some insights.  How would i do the following query:

1. we have a .ruby-version in every repo, how would i write a query to do that. Example file contents:

3.0.3

2. get the version of a gem used by apps from either Gemfile or Gemfile.lock. ie nokgiri version across all our apps
### Application Engineer Answer
@adam
, got a couple of options for you to try out here
for;
file:.ruby-version.tt content:#.ruby-version or  file:.ruby-version (\d+\.\d+\.\d+) should generate some results when you plug into the insight. Also, it would be great to know if you'd like to track changes or patterns on this file?The two options are available in the UI of course. Previewing the results before publishing the insight will also show if we have desirable results.
file:Gemfile nokogiri (\d+\.\d+\.\d+) patterntype:regexp which will return version numbers for nokogiri
