## Summary
### Customer Question

Is there a way to search/filter by repository size?  I read the docs and such but did not see anything.

### Application Engineer Answer

Hey @John Guin after looking around I've confirmed my suspicions there currently no search filter accessible that can filter results based on repo sizeThere does however exit a field that can be queries via the graphQL API but this is intended for internal use only -- and should only be accessible to a site admin -- the field is called RepositoryStats but as you can see in screenshots its got a big warning sign on it suggesting its for use by Sourcegraph internals (i.e. Sourcegraph itself consumes this)A regular flag for our search query language would be really cool though, flagging @Nate Maynard OOO 2/14-2/18 here for a feature request on this
