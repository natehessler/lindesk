## Summary
### Customer Question
We got some alerts on graphana dashboard, are there any actionable for it? or should I worry about those notification?

### Application Engineer Answer
`1+ permissions sync error rate for 1m0s` is probably the most concerning in this list. no one has reported they're unable to access to their repos so I asked the customer to try searching for some of the repos associated with this error to make sure they're still accessible. 
<br />
`less than 0 repositories synced for 9h0m0s` should be ok to ignore, all their repos have been synced  <br />
`less than 5 active connections for 5m0s` can be ignored. We are actually in the process of possibly removing this alert from Sourcegraph<br />
`1+ errors scraping postgres exporter for 5m0s` should not require any action either. Postgres Exporter was added to kubernetes deployments in version 3.39 so this alert may not be relevant.
