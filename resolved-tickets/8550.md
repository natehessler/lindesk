## Summary
### Customer Question
Does the gitserver fully clone all repos, when I ssh into the a gitserver instnaces and ls /data/repos/&lt;code-host&gt;/repo I see that the directory is empty apart from a .git file. Is this expected?
### Application Engineer Answer
Hey Katie! Happy to help out with this.
Yes this expected. Gitserver keeps a shallow clone of a repo so you won't see the files exactly. Running ls -la in the .git directory you'll be able to see branches and other sub directories.
In simpler terms, basically gitserver is like a cache of your code host.
