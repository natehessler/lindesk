## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue
- Customer's new instance failes to clone large monorepo.


### Troubleshooting Steps
- Have customer attempt to clone into a new ec2 instance (this times out)
- Have the customer report the error message from gitserver


### Resolution
- Customer reports that configuring the gitLongCommandTimeout solves the issue, as their monorepo takes more than the default 1hr time limit to clone
