## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Syntax highlighting missing

### Troubleshooting Steps
Not sure how legitimate these are, but:
> Is the file that you are trying to view particularly large? And is it in a language that is already in your repository? If the language is a common one, could you try viewing a smaller file of the same language and let me know how that goes? I'm wondering if the language is the issue, or if it's just a scaling thing

> Does your org have a monorepo type of architecture? Sometimes, the implications of scale/size of monorepos will point us towards a resource-allocation-based sollution

And of course, searching in our internal solved tickets repo surfaced [this](https://github.com/sourcegraph/support-tools-internal/blob/c14a3615599eb25de63f8f72ef8dcee3bf5b3b35/resolved-tickets/4694.md), leading to some high confidence it was just a provisioning thing.

### Resolution
Customer seems satisfied with answer that it's likely lack of provisioning/resources to their deployment.
