## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

Customer server crashing on single docker instance when attempting to upgrade to 3.33 from 3.31.2.



### Troubleshooting Steps

Customer diagnosed the issue, which was correct, and is being fixed in version 3.34 to be release next week.



### Resolution

Decided the best action going forward was to stay on 3.33 and add the --restart=unless-stopped flag to the docker run command so that the server can restart each time it crashes. Temporary fix while they await 3.34.
