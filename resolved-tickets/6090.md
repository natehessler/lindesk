## Summary
### Customer Question
We have the search-export plugin installed, but the CSVs it generated are very partial (getting a csv with 14 rows on a search with 500+ results).
This makes it impossible to use sourcegraph to get data to be used elsewhere.
Can you provide any help with this?
### Application Engineer Answer
Understood.
Fairly easy fix for this. Could you please try to add the exhaustive search filter to your query:
This would be count:all
Also, if it helps, we have a doc that explains this discrepancy and offers a workaround for it by using the above filter.
Perhaps you can try this and see if it makes any difference towards expected outcome for you.
