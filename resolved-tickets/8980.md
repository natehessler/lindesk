## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Customer locked out of account with the following error:
No user exists matching any of the verified emails: bachiri.abderrahman@gmail.com, bachiri.abderrahman@glovoapp.com.

First error was: User account with verified email "bachiri.abderrahman@gmail.com" does not exist. Ask a site admin to create your account and then verify your email

However, upon checking pgsql for this user, they were definitely registered. The UI also reflected that they were not only registered, but verified as well.

### Resolution
Forced a sign out in the UI. Customer was able to log back in after that.
