## Summary
### Customer Question
Our Observability Team had brought to my attention that the Docker Host Server for SourceGraph was often consuming swap memory at over 99%.
We were of thinking of increasing the 2g to 4g to see if this helps, as the Docker Host itself has plenty of available memory still, would this be ok to?
### Application Engineer Answer
Yes it's absolutely okay to bump up mem_limit. Just for reference, our current docker manifest has it defaulted to 4g.
Please feel free to scale up or down as needed.
