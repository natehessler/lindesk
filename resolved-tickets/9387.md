## Summary
### Customer Question
is there a way to update a block on the frontpage of a sourcegraph instance?Similar to your video/quick-start/tips-and-tricks blocks on https://sourcegraph.com/search

### Application Engineer Answer
Hi,| will be helping you out with this. You can update the front page ( Home Screen) of source graph instance and add quick links or block of text by changing the below parameters under Site Admin->Global Settings. To add a text you can use setting “notices”, below is an example snippet from Global settings
"notices": [
  {
  //  "dismissible": false,
   "location": "top",
   "message": "TEXT you want to display on home screen"
  },

Also for Quick links , you can add the name and url as shown in below snippet from Global settings
"quicklinks": [
   {
    "name": "Description for your link"
    "url": "link url you want to embed"
   },

You can find more information about such Global setting parameters here.I am also attaching the screenshot as examples on how to apply these Global settings for your reference. Please let me know if you have any further queries on this or you look for something else.
