## Summary
### Customer Question
Can you modify a Batch change that has been deployed?
For Instance, A batch change that creates a file, we would like to rename the file created.

### Application Engineer Answer
When you create a batch change to create a file and its been merged,  If you would like to rename the file you would have to create a new spec on a different branch to rename the file. 

If its not been merged yet,  It is possible to modify the batch spec as long as its not merged yet.
You can run preview on the modified spec, so it should now have a modified status. The current PR would be closed in the codehost and archived in the sourcegraph.
To modify a batch change that is not yet merged, You need to modify the batch spec by including the branch name (of the existing PR ) and use a different branch name for the changeset .
