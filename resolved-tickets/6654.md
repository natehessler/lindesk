## Summary
### Customer Question
Is there a nice, "go to file" shortcut that is provided in the Sourcegraph UI, similar to GitHub's go-to-file feature?

### Application Engineer Answer
No, not really ]:  Nothing as nice as GitHub's feature. But one can try using the file: keyword to limit the search space, and also combine that with [search contexts](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/explanations/features#search-contexts) . Not nearly as ergonomic as GitHub's, but it's... a start lolz.
