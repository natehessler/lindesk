## Summary
### Customer Question
Is there a GraphQL endpoint to get user data, when someone logged in, how many users logged in by hour. Would that come for the postgres DB for some other?

### Application Engineer Answer
This data comes from the users table, just made easier to digest /site-admin/usage-statistics
The options for activePeriod, are “TODAY”, “THIS_WEEK”, “THIS_MONTH”, and “ALL_TIME”. The smallest granularity is by day, so filtering by hour would be a feature request.
Jonah has shared this feedback with the product team.
