## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue:  
Customer wants to fetch the repositories and their owners through the SourceGraph query itself, which I can export later to have a 1:1 mapping between repo and owner. 


### Troubleshooting Steps:  
At the moment, The author:<name> keyword can be used to get the name of the person who authored a commit or diff , it also requires type:commit or type:diff in the search query. However you have to input the name of the author, so you have to know who the author is.
As an alternative, we have an extension API you can leverage on to bring that information inline to at least see it, similar to how the GH code ownership extension works . Also, it was discovered that this graphQl query works well on docker-compose but the customer is on Kubernetes.



### Resolution:  
A feature request is to be created by the CE to get the prooduct team to look into the possibilities of fetching bitbucket owners using a search query.
