## Summary
### Customer Question

A customer hoping to use the Sourcegraph IntelliJ plugin wanted to know how to configure the plugin to reference a Sourcegraph instance other than Sourcegraph.com

### Application Engineer Answer

Hey Wolf,

I've done a little investigation and setup on my end and I'm not sure it will be necessary to open up a thread in our #support-twitter slack channel, we can still investigate that if the following configuration options don't work for you.

In order to point the IntelliJ at a private Sourcegraph instance, you'll need to create a .sourcegraph-jetbrains.properties in your home directory Ex:
url = https://cse-k8s.sgdev.org/
# defaultBranch = main
# remoteUrlReplacements = git.example.com, git-web.example.com


Above I've configured the instance to target a test deployment for our team, and the plugin is opening files in my Sourcegraph test instance.

You can also find more information in the extensions Readme --
https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-jetbrains/-/blob/README.md#configuring-for-use-with-a-private-sourcegraph-instance

It's possible that your team may need to use remoteUrlReplacement option to target your Source monorepo, let me know if you run into any troubles there.

I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any follow-up questions.
