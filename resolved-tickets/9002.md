## Summary
### Customer Question
how can i get the name of the repository within a batch change script?
the usual methods i tried from here don't seem to work since sourcegraph downloads an archive of the repo: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` returns /work
`git remote get-url origin` is blank

### Application Engineer Answer
You can use the name of the repo in the batch spec by using ${{ repository.name }}.
