## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

A subset of the customer's repos are not syncing. Even though many repos are able to sync under the same code host, a small subset are not.

A quote, from the customer:

> we only have 1 codehost (githubpie). We were able to clone 650+ repos/ only 10 repos or so giving this error

The primary error culprit seems to be:

```
OpenSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL in connection to github.pie.apple.com:443 \\n\": exit status 128
```




### Troubleshooting Steps

Asked the customer to attempt a git fetch in the directory of the repos that are not syncing, to see if the command would surface any additional errors that could be used as investigation points. However, customer has yet to get back to me on that.





### Resolution



Unfortunately, no real resolution. The customer had not attempted the investigation and hasn't gotten back to us regarding the status of the repos.
