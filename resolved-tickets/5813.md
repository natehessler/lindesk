## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The template helper function doesn't work correctly with file extension name with space in it. It throws errors.
### Troubleshooting Steps

### Resolution
I was able to reproduce the issue, and indeed the template helper function doesn't work correctly with file extension name with space in it. It's as a result of shell quoting which we don't have control over. Currently, there isn't a fix to this. I have engaged the team responsible for this bit of the product and it's something they are going to look into. I can't give an ETA at this time but I would like to say a big thank you for bringing this to our attention feedbacks like this helps makes the product better.
