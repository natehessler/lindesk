## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer got the following error when trying to view LSIF uploads
```
ERROR: permission denied for view lsif_uploads_with_repository_name (SQLSTATE 42501)
```
They had tried to fix it by running a few `GRANT ALL` commands but saw no improvement
### Application Engineer Answer
I asked them to run the following and this fixed it
```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <username>;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <username>;
```
