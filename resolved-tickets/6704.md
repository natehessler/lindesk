## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Customer asked how to change logging levels in frontend. Also seemed like they were having database migration issues, based on logs shared. This ticket very similar in resolution to 6727 ([Zendesk](https://sourcegraph.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/6727), [GitHub Resolved Ticket](https://github.com/sourcegraph/support-tools-internal/blob/main/resolved-tickets/6727.md))

### Troubleshooting Steps
Frontend logging levels are available [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/logs). 

Just checked with the resolved tickets for keywords from the logs. But also, the logs seemed to make it pretty clear that there were database issues. Checked their version  using looker to make sure the [database migration docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/how-to/dirty_database_pre_3_37
) would be relevant. Just seems like the version needs to be before 3.37 to be relevant; customer was on 3.34.2 üëç

### Resolution
None, sort of. Giselle ended up working with the customer in a [different thread/ticket](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C02QXK6PKMX/p1647028504817209) (a bit more specifically [here](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C02QXK6PKMX/p1647039208527859?thread_ts=1647028504.817209&cid=C02QXK6PKMX) , a thread in the pandora channel march 11th) , and they disabled the codeinsights db using `DISABLE_CODE_INSIGHTS: true `, which seems to be an environment variable... somewhere.

Since code insights got disabled, logs no longer surfaced regarding code insight migrations.
