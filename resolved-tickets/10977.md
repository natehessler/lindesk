## Summary
### Customer Question
search-export csv provide less results than seen in the UI 

### Application Engineer Answer
The sourcegraph UI uses the streaming API, while the extension uses the GraphQL API. I believe this explains the disparities in results.  Adding `count:all` to the query before exporting.
