## Summary

### Customer Question
Inquiry about several error messages --
```

Failed to run operations on changeset
Creating commit from patch for repository "github.com/unity-technologies/ads-accelerate-bids": gitserver: pushing ref: exit status 128
$ git push --force https://<redacted>@github.com/Unity-Technologies/ads-accelerate-bids e553c556c13a2c4131f1d756e559bb11c80aa94c:refs/heads/helm3-update-campaign
fatal: could not read Password for 'https://<redacted>@github.com': No such device or address
```

```
Creating changeset: error in GraphQL response: was submitted too quickly
```


### Application Engineer Answer

These errors are the result of an expired PAT, the customer was asked to generate a new token.

The second error is from github with a graph QL rate limit being hit. This needs to be waited out.
