i can help answer your question.
You are looking for .csproj files that do not contain `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>` .You can search using the following query`file:.csproj -content:<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>` This would exclude files that contain `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>`  in search results.
