## Summary
Customer wanted to bypass providing a `username` and `password` for their SMTP server.

At first, I had tried fiddling with passing or not-passing the fields through the configuration. But it turns out, one can just set `authentication: 'none'` to bypass the `username` and `password` requirements.


### Customer Question

Is there a way to not require neither a `username` nor `password`?

### Application Engineer Answer
Yes. You can set the `authentication` to `'none'`
