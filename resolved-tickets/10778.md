## Summary
### Customer Question

The customer is seeing multiple calls from sourcegraph on their GHE server one call for the failed attempt and the second attempt succeeded in case of their repository visibly changes from public to public with private mode enabled.

### Application Engineer Answer
Looks like this is desired behavior from GitHub when the repository is accessed over HTTP as a workaround customer used ssh for repository authentication to avoid any failed calls.
