## Summary
### Customer Question

What's the method for a user to sign in via OAuth for multiple GitHub / GHE code hosts, and have their accounts connect to each other, so all their access / permissions are on the same account, and so they only take one license?

Do their email addresses need to be the same on their separate accounts, or is it something else?

### Application Engineer Answer

Currently, in Sourcegraph the Identity from a provider like GitHub is mapped to a Sourcegraph user by comparing the user’s verified email address to the email address from the external identity provider. There is no way to map a user with different email addresses under one username. However, I see an option here to merge user accounts on GitHub.

I am looping my colleague @Mike McLaughlin to check if this can be considered as a possible feature request.
