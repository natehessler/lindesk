## Summary
### Customer Question
Deployment: cadvisor is mounting /var and /dev on the host. Can you help us understand why ?

### Application Engineer Answer
​Here’s an explanation:cAdvisor is an open source tool that Sourcegraph leverages to get usage statistics about all of the services operating within your Sourcegraph cluster. (i.e. memory usage, CPU usage, etc.)cAdvisor relies on specific Linux directories on the machines that it is deployed to in order to accurately report this data. (i.e. /var/run/,  /sys, /dev/disk, /dev/kmsg).The directories listed above are specifically used by the linux OS to report the usage statistics previously discussed.Without mounting volumes to these paths on the host cAdvisor is unable to collect usage data from the node and pass it along to the data scraping Prometheus service.Without the data from the Prometheus service there would be no visibility in to how any of the components within your Sourcegraph instance are functioning and it would make it impossible to troubleshoot with any accuracy.
