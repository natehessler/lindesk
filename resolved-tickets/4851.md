## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue
We are getting user reports that the keyboard shortcuts don't work in the browser.



### Troubleshooting Steps
Tested the shortcuts in Chrome,  Firefox, and Chrome on Windows and Mac.



### Resolution

The shortcuts for toggling the History Panel and Line Wrap were not working on Mac because alt+h and alt+z are used to create special characters instead of returning key attributes.
