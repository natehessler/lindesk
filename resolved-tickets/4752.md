## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue
The customer reported that the following regex query resulted in an error `(?i)github.{0,3}((?i)token|api|key).{0,10}?(?-i)([0-9a-zA-Z]{35,40})`.



### Troubleshooting Steps
I tested this query on 3.33.0 and 3.34.0 but I was not able to reproduce the error. I recreated the error by adding `type:repo` to the query.



### Resolution
I suggested to the customer that they should try to add `type:file` to search file contents. I believe the customer was using the `type:repo` filter. The regex query is valid for file contents but not file names. This seems to be a known [issue](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C023ELQLV7F/p1636702089111300)
