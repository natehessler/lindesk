## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue:  

After installing Sourcegraph and adding API key, admin-level users only see 95 repos instead of expected 148 repos

### Troubleshooting Steps:  

- Check repo-updater logs and grafana, but found no errors or performance issues
- Grafana shows repo-updater sync queue managing less than 148 repos, so issue is not sync errors, but GitHub API not returning all repos
- This suggests an API Key permissions level issue, so ask admin to issue a new API Key

### Resolution:  

New GitHub API Key installed, users now able to see all expected repositories

### Relevant Error / Logs:
