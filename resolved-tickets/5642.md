## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
repos not syncing

### Troubleshooting Steps
Asked for logs... sourcegraph-frontend-*, repo-updater, gitserver, the usuals.

Also suggested a manual resync: 

> If you navigate to the repository's settings, and select "Mirroring", there should be a button for "Refresh now" that manually fires a sync.

... But this is only reasonable for small numbers of repositories (otherwise it becomes tedious), this solution does not scale well.

### Resolution

None... Customer did not respond with logs.
