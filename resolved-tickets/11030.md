## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
User cannot access the repo on sourcegraph but can access the same repo in the code host.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- Is this your first time logging into sourcegraph?
- If not, Are you able to search the repository where this file is present as seen in the code host?
- The user clarified that he can access the repo in the code host but not on sourcegraph. This explains why you are unable to see results from the repo.
- We would need the help of a site admin to confirm if this repo is indexed on your sourcegraph instance. Also, to rule out any permission issue here as well.

### Resolution
This appears to be a permission sync-related issue and after a permission sync was done the issue is now resolved.
