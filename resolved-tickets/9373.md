## Summary
### Customer Question

Hi teams, I tested the batch change feature. I have write permission but have the Branch protection rules so that I can not merge to any branch directly. (our registered users can merge after reviewing by gerrit tools). And I try to run batch changes with that repository, and publish batch set. The status is Unpublished even though I click “publish on apply”, and the Action field shows “No Action”. Is it right flow? what means “No action” ?

### Application Engineer Answer

Hi ,

| will help you with this issue. While publishing the changesets by default the “published” field is set to “false” and only displays the preview of changes that are “unpublished”. You need to set it to “true” to publish the changes, below documentation has more details around this:

Please let me know if it resolves your query.
