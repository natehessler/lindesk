## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Hi, I have another question. Could you tell me, is there any offset parameter in search query syntax? I don’t see it in the https://docs.sourcegraph.com/@3.40/code_search/reference/queriesreference>. I would like to limit my search results with count:N property and in the second run I would like to get next batch of repositories. It’s because when I try to make query without limit, I get the error like below:
✅ Parsing batch spec
✅ Resolving namespace
✅ Preparing container images
✅ Set workspace type
⠸ Resolving repositories
❌ Error:
resolving repositories: error: 504 Gateway Timeout``
I also tried to set timeout:60s(60s` is the maximum value) but nothing has changed.
### Troubleshooting Steps
Run the spec file with on.repository as opposed to on.repositorymatchingquery. 

Reduce scope of repositories.
### Resolution
With a reduced number of repos. I asked the customer to attempt with 15. This worked. The idea is to scope them out to avoid hitting rate limits.
