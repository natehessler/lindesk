## Summary
### Customer Question
I could need a little help with a structural search query, and I don’t know if this should be possible.
I’m trying to find cases where a method named `add_method_tracer` is called with more than one argument in a Ruby file.
This works with this query: `file:.rb add_method_tracer(...,...)`
However, in Ruby, when calling a method the parentheses are optional. How to get matches for methods without parentheses in Ruby?

### Application Engineer Answer
```
<method_name>:[~.*,.*] or add_method_tracer(...,...)
```
