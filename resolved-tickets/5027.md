## Summary

### Customer Question

The customer wants to change his sourcegraph username.

### Application Engineer Answer

If you are running a self-hosted version, you can definitely change your username by ;
 

- Going to the site admin page.
- Next, click on the `Users` page where you see a list of users.
- You can now click on your username and make the necessary edits and save.

 
However, If you are using sourcegraph.com, Unfortunately, we can't edit a username on sourcegraph.com. You can either choose to delete the account and recreate it with the desired username or continue to use the current username.
