## Summary
### Customer Question
Extensions page has this error. Where do you recommend checking here?  
`Unable to contact extension registry: Get "https://sourcegraph.com/.api/registry/extensions": read tcp: read: connection reset by peer`

### Application Engineer Answer
The connection to the extension registry on sourcegraph(dot)com might be blocked by a firewall. Sourcegraph.com would have to be added to an allowlist.
