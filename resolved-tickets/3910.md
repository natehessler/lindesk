## Summary
src-cli was not running a command, and client asks for support. Application engineer thought that seeking info from the .yaml file would be helpful, but it wasn't related, which may have been a bit of a misfire, unfortunately.

Ultimately, it was a code bug. Not sure how an Application Engineer would be able to surface though, unfortunately. At best, this summary connects the error message to the fix, but doesn't provide a full, learnable lesson.
 

### Description of Customer Issue

src batch repos was firing an error message.



### Troubleshooting Steps
None, unfortunately. Asking for the .yaml file may actually have been a misfire in this case, as the application engineer never gave a reason to investigate it. Best to provide customer justification for action.



### Resolution

The error message was a result of a bug in the source code. Upgrading to src-cli to 3.32.1 was mentioned [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/533#issuecomment-947243556) would fix it.
