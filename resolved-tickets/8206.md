## Summary
### Customer Question
Hi team after I moved some repos under another project I am seeing this.
Repository not found
I have multiple repos that needs refreshed.
### Application Engineer Answer
The site admin can trigger this sync manually by navigating to Site admin>Repository status>$name_of_repo>Settings>Mirroring and clicking on Refresh nowThis will add the repo in the update queue and will give a timeframe when it'll be updated.

There's a repo update interval that does this automatically.
