Hi Team,

We would like to monitor License Info from our Prometheus Alert Manager. Is there any API for getting license Info like number of days remaining for license to get expire .

### Application Engineer Answer

You can use the below api via graphql frontend or src-cli to access the information about license expiry but unfortunately, this can not be integrated into the alert system as alerts are not customizable at the moment.

The below link provides a list of Alerts currently available in the system 

https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/alerts

Graphql:
‘query {site{
  productSubscription {
   maximumAllowedUserCount
license {
expiresAt
} 
 }’

src-cli
Src api -query=‘query {site{
  productSubscription {
   maximumAllowedUserCount
license {
expiresAt
} 
 }’
