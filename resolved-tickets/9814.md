## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
I work at DFINITY, and I used to be able to search [our ic repo](https://github.com/dfinity/ic) using SG, but this week, SG suddenly stopped giving me results in the ic repo. For example, I expected that [this query](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:dfinity+f:sns/govern&patternType=regexp&case=yes) would lead to results in [this directory](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/sns/governance), but I get no results. Is this a mistake? Am I doing something wrong? Or is SG intentionally no longer providing such results? If SG is no longer serving ic repo results, I'd like to know why that is.

### Troubleshooting Steps

### Resolution
I see you are trying to get files in the `sns/govern` directory found in the ic repository.
You can modify your search query using any of the following ways to get results:
- `repo:dfinity/ic  sns/govern`
- `repo:dfinity/ sns/govern`
