## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
the symlink file is shows a path to the source file instead of the actual content.
### Troubleshooting Steps
I was able to reproduce this behaviour.
### Resolution
I can confirm that when searching a symlink file.
It will contain a reference to the source file.
I understand this is certainly room for improvement and will be communicated to the team as a feature request.
