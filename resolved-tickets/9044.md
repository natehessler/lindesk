## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer experienced a complete inability to search their monorepo due to corruption caused by a bad ref error.
​
### Troubleshooting Steps
​
1. The gitserver logs were looked at.
2. The logs determined that a clone was not possible due to a "bad ref error" causing a corrupted repo.

### Resolution
​
The bad reference object turned out to be a branch that could be removed from the repository without consequence.
​
The customer removed the branch on the call from the upstream (the code host) and then Sourcegraph was able to successfully clone the repo without any corruption.
