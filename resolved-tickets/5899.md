## Summary
The customer wanted to know how to use src-cli to search regex format with pagination.
I suggested trying -stream and -patternType:structural and that seems to solve it for him.

### Customer Question
I am using Sourcegraph CLI and sometimes when I search the result is huge. How can I paginate the result and get it in steps?
I checked -stream flag again but It seems only works with V2 API and "literature" query.
I wish It worked with regex too. Am I right?

### Application Engineer Answer
Can you try adding -stream flag to your query? This doc can also guide you with all the available features in src search

Yes, you can use src-cli  on regex by using structural search. You can do this by adding patternType:structural to your query like this”
src search -json '([a-z\-]+)?:?(\/\/)?([a-zA-Z0-9]+[.])+('example\.com') count:5000 patternType:structural'
