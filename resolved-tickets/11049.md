## Summary
### Customer Question
can Sourcegraph while applying batch changes use my personal data as Author in commit metadata?

### Application Engineer Answer
Yes this is possible.
We have a `changesetTemplate.commit.author` as seen in the [doc](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/batch_changes/references/batch_spec_yaml_reference#changesettemplate-commit-author) that you can include in your Batch spec which allows you to apply the name and email of the git commit author.
Examples

```
changesetTemplate:
  commit:
    author:
      name: Alan Turing
      email: <mailto:alan.turing@example.com|alan.turing@example.com>
      ```
