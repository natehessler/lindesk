## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer experienced Docker volume errors from the change from timescale to Postgres database.
​
### Troubleshooting Steps
Could not start a bash shell into the container since the codeinsights-db container was stuck in the created/restarting status.
​
This made it not possible to get access to the volume and edit the config.
​
​The codeinsights-db not being able to start was stopping the frontend from starting due to this dependency.
​

### Resolution
​
It was decided to delete the volume since the customer wasn’t a Code Insights user and then restart the deployment and rebuild the volume with the config that does not include the timescaledb configuration.
