## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue
The customer reported that after setting up GitHub SSO and visiting the login page, they were redirected to a 404 page. 
```
"auth.providers": [
 {
 "type": "github",
 "allowSignup": false,
 "allowOrgs": ["orgname"],
 "clientID": "<app id>",
 "clientSecret": "<app secret>"
 }
 ],

```



### Troubleshooting Steps
I set up an instance with the customer's settings and everything worked fine for me. This led me to believe that there was something wrong with their GitHub App.



### Resolution
The customer shared a screenshot of their GitHub App and I could see that the app was set up as a regular app instead of an OAuth App. We changed the GitHub App to a GitHub OAuth App and this worked for the customer.
