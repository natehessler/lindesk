## Summary
### Customer Question
The customer was setting up Okta integration as part of their Sourcegraph trial, and could not access the metadata url to finish their auth configuration. They did, however, have access to the actual metadata itself.

### Application Engineer Answer
Alright, so poking around in the instructions for adding a SAML provider, I'm seeing that there is an option for providing just the metadata itself if the URL isn't available - example 2 [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/auth/saml#add-a-saml-provider). Based on the Okta docs [here](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/idp-add-metadata.htm), your team should be able to download a long XML string from Okta, and pass that into the `identityProviderMetada` field in your auth configuration.
