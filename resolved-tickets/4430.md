## Summary

###Customer Question

Can we get guidance on testing to see if codeIntel.lsif: true is working?


### CSE Answer

There are two ways that you can check if lsif is active. 

Make sure you're searches are yielding semantic, not search-based, results.
Checking if the precise badge is visible on hover tooltips.
