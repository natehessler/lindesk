## Summary
### Customer Question
Can I do search for repos that have at least one file whose contents match a search expression? If I can do that, can I do a search for repos that DON'T have a file whose contents match a search expression AND have at least one file whose contents do match another search expression?
### Application Engineer Answer
If I’m understanding your goal correctly, I think your first request is covered by our `content` filter (more on that in our search keyword doc).
If that works for you, then you should be able to use `-content` along with the `AND` operator for your other question.
