## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer complained of not being able to auto-index repos after upgrading to 4.1. They then tried upgrading to 4.2.1 and found that the same problem was occurring.

### Troubleshooting Steps
Checked connections between pods. Checked resources. Checked container configs.

### Resolution
Ultimately, They had a special PROXY  running between all Sourcegraph services, and blobstore was incorrectly not on the NO_PROXY list (they had minio, but not blobstore) so their proxy was rejecting LSIF upload HTTP requests for some reason and returning an HTML response instead of an XML one, leading to the error.
