## Summary
### Customer Question

Hi Rakesh.
now I’m trying to apply nodeSelector for seperate our other service in same eks clusters.
and I’m wondering how to apply nodeSelector for all services.

### Application Engineer Answer

You have to define it as a global node selector and then use Common select labels to select pods that belong to the current deployment. Please refer to this link, it has an example override.yaml file which explains how to do this.Hope this helps!
