## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer has Kubernetes version 1.23 in staging and the API version in his sourcegraph deployment isn't compatible with Kubernetes.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- My understanding here is kube 1.23 is the latest version of Kubernetes. I see the customer is on version 3.34.2.

### Resolution

I checked the next version of sourcegraph 3.35 and we are using the networking.k8s.io/v1.
Upgrading to a more updated version can help solve this problem.
