## Summary
### Customer Question
Hi! I was wondering if someone could help me with a query I’m trying to do
This may end up just being a fancy regex, but I also haven’t used the structural search so not sure if it’s capable of this.I’m trying to find all files which include a keyword (axios) but don’t include the import for that keyword, .i.e. import axios from 'axios'
### Application Engineer Answer
axios AND NOT import axios

Just to chime in here, if I may, you can also use the file:contains.content and -file:contains.content filters to get matching repository results for the same use case you shared above.Happy to share search references that can help with query construction here.
