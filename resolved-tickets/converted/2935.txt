Picking this issue up from Amber. The customer reported slow searches and a grafana warning related to code intel search requests. On top of that, Ankit wanted to find out why the repo updater had an error around 0 repositories synced for more than 9h0m. On top of that, the symbols pod was getting evicted after deployment and dumping old data when the disk was fool
Hopped onto a call with the customer to take a look at the Grafana dashboard and saw that the code-intel error was cleared from the frontend. This was after the upgrade. All services were stable and within threshold
Mike and I decided to close this since the customer is in a good state after the call and their questions answered.
