## Summary
### Customer Question
I am trying to figure out why my query is not returning any results.   
context:global search-term file:yarn.lock

### Application Engineer Answer
Can we add yarn.lock files to search.largeFiles in the site config?  
This will cause the repos to reindex and the lock files should be included in searches. This setting uses glob patterns so something like this should index that file.

```
"search.largeFiles": [
        "**/yarn.lock",
        "**/package-lock.json"
    ],
```
