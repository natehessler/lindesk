## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Some non-admin users cannot see specific repos they have access to in the CodeHost.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- cross-checked to see if their token [has the prerequisite scopes](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/external_service/github#github-api-token-and-access) (`repo`, `write:org`) and both read and write access to all relevant repositories and organisations - They confirmed the repo has all the scopes
- we discovered internal repos were not appearing.
### Resolution
- We noticed that when we manually tried to sync a user there was an error coming from our group caching code which stopped permissions form being synced. We asked the customer to disable group caching and from that point could see that we were working through the queue, although slower than we would expect. 

- Their current workaround is they created a new team group and added users to it and now they are able to access internal repos.
