## Summary

### Customer Question

Admin was confused because they couldn't see lsif files they were uploading in their s3 bucket. This is because the files are only temporarily stored.
### Application Engineer Answer

While investigating this the customer set the bucket to enable versioning and was able to observe the creation of new dump.lsif files in the bucket
