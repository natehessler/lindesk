## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
 The customer is not able to run regex queries related to repo:contains.file() using "AND" operator. While running such queries the frontend pod dies with OOM due to high memory consumption.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- Ran the query locally to see the results with different operators 
- Checked Grafana dashboard, repo updater/Git server/Front end logs to check for issues
- Replicated the issue on K8 env.


### Resolution

The search specific to repo:contains.file() and AND operator is currently having performance issues and being handled by engineering via Git hub issue 37629. Customer will use the different search options to handle this for now.
