## Summary
### Customer Question
The previous version of sourcegraph had a checkbox for sending notifications to my email for saved searches, but I noticed the new one does not. Will it send an email by default?

### Application Engineer Answer
Code monitoring has essentially replaced saved searches. All you need to do to get notifications again, is to create a new code monitor in the code monitoring tab of sourcegraph, and set your trigger and configure your email.
