## Summary
### Customer Question

Hi all, Is there a way to see the logs from the script run in the container for each repo? Specifically, I'm trying to get more detail on why the change attempt fails. I feel like I must be missing something simple.

### Application Engineer Answer
The flag -keep-logs applied to either the src batch apply or src batch preview command.
