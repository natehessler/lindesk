## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

I’ve changed my username on nearly all of my social services.  I would like to do the same here on Sourcegraph and change my username from “a” to “b”.  If a username change is not possible, then I would like to have my account deleted so I may recreate it.


### Troubleshooting Steps

If you are running a self-hosted version, you can definitely change your username by ;

- Going to the site admin page.
- Next, click on the Users page where you see a list of users.
- You can now click on your username and make the necessary edits and save.


### Resolution

Unfortunately, we can't edit a username on sourcegraph.com so I've deleted the account and now you can re-create an account with the desired username.
