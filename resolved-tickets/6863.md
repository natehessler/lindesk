## Summary
### Customer Question

i’ve got 1000+ feature flags, and I’d like to automate a sourcegraph search for each flag so i can aggregate the results and determine which flags are referenced in multiple repos. Anyone have tips for how i might do that?

### Application Engineer Answer

Hey again @Jake Taylor, wanted to share some thoughts with you here.In my understanding of your use case I think running searches against our graphQL api is probably going to be really handy, there you can gather info like repositoriesCount to be consumed programmatically. You can also use this api via src with the src api sub command (doc).Heres an example of a such a query on a test instance of mine, and its resultsquery -
{
  search(query: "rare string") {
    stats {
      approximateResultCount
    }
    results {
      repositoriesCount
      matchCount
      repositories {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}

results
{
  "data": {
    "search": {
      "stats": {
        "approximateResultCount": "28"
      },
      "results": {
        "repositoriesCount": 8,
        "matchCount": 28,
        "repositories": [
          {
            "name": "github.com/sourcegraph/handbook"
          },
          {
            "name": "github.com/sourcegraph/openvscode-server"
          },
          {
            "name": "github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-static-doc-examples"
          },
          {
            "name": "github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-clang"
          },
          {
            "name": "github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt"
          },
          {
            "name": "github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph"
          },
          {
            "name": "github.com/Rhia2/lmas"
          },
          {
            "name": "github.com/Rhia2/lighthouse"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}

Finally a screenshot of the graphQL API console where you can find a bunch more information about the parameters available, by browsing the explorer panel (on the right side in the screenshot)Let me know what you think and if this gets you towards your end goal

### Further Context

It turned out that the customer was in version 3.32.0 and in that version some graphQL fields - repositories and repositorieMatch are different -- see this PR for more info on the change
