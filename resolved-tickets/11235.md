## Summary
### Customer Question
I switched my source graph sync user to a new user and generated new ssh keys. after the update i am unable to sync latest changes. I keep getting "Error: Host key verification failed". I dont have a config file defined in my ssh folder .sourcegraph/config/ssh am i missing anything here

### Application Engineer Answer
The files in $HOME/.sourcegraph/config are copied into /etc/sourcegraph. Can you confirm if these files were copied correctly?
Customer: I had two sets of keys id_ed25519 and id_rsa i had to overwrite id_rsa with ed25519 keys.
