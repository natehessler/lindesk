## Summary
### Customer Question
I could use some pointers on how to deal with large response sizes via the GraphQL API.  I suspect I either need to paginate, or set the max number of items to be returned.z

### Application Engineer Answer
We don’t support pagination, but you can use count:all to run an exhaustive search.
