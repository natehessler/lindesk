## Summary
### Customer Question
Does SourceGraph support the use of [state parameters](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/oauth2.html#prevent-csrf-attacks) and [PKCE](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/oauth2.html#authorization-code-with-proof-key-for-code-exchange-pkce) using Gitlab SSO?  

### Application Engineer Answer
I understand that at the moment we don't support PKCE, we do however use CSRF token in the state parameter.
In addition, to answer your question on scope parameters, The default scope is `api`, but it is possible to change it using the [apiScope](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/oauth2.html#authorization-code-with-proof-key-for-code-exchange-pkce) configuration.
We require the `api` scope to allow access to private repos, if we remove that scope users will only be able to see public repos.
