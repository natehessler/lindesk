## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue:  

Customer had a previous kubernetes instance of sourcegraph that she used to create an API key. After tearing that instance down and creating a new instance, she was still able to use the same API key to auth into the src CLI.



### Troubleshooting Steps:  

This was difficult to troubleshoot. In the middle of doing so the customer replied and said that the old API key was no longer working.



### Resolution:  

Strange behavior seems to have spontaneously stopped. I am posting a summary here in case this ever comes up again. Seems like a strange issue and one that we definitely want to resolve should we find it again, but I could not find anything relevant in the docs/logs.
