## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer upgraded to 3.38.0 and has stopped seeing Jaeger trace ids in response headers since then. They tried turning on tracing for all requests, but are still only seeing traces for `gitserver`. I suggested they upgrade further to 3.38.1, but there was no change in the behavior.
 
### Troubleshooting Steps
Add `&trace=1` to the url of a Sourcegraph search to confirm no trace in the response headers
I also took this opportunity to test tracing on my own local docker-compose instance, which was at 3.37 and working as expected, before upgrading to 3.38.0 and then 3.38.1. In both cases I also saw no trace id in the headers. This was also true of our cse test instances.
 
### Resolution
Tracing seems to be working just fine in the latest insiders release, so upgrading to 3.39 when it's released on April 20th should solve this.
