## Summary
### Customer Question
Hello! Quick Question on saved searches: are saved searches only visible to the user who saved them? Can their visibility be increased to a wider audience, like “everyone at Tinder”?
### Application Engineer Answer
You can create saved searches available to all members that are part of an org, all users on an instance can be added to an org via the auth.userOrgMap site config
