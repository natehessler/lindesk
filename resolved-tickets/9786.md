## Summary

The customer noticed that one of the mounts (/data/repos) inside of its second gitserver replica was full.
This is expected behavior according to https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/engineering/teams/repo-management/how-gitserver-works/#production-instances. 
Currently, Sourcegraph shards repositories across gitserver instances using a modular hashing strategy based on the repository name. This is the responsibility of the gitserver client.

Since the other two mounts on the other two replicas were not full, the load is being balanced correctly. I advised the customer to keep tabs on the mountsand add another replica to the deployment if they find that the other mounts start to fill up.
