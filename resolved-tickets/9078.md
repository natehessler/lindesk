## Summary
### Customer Question
this sourcegraph query isn't quite doing what I would expect.. any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

repo:1debit lang:ruby (.cards AND NOT .cards[A-Z_]) still shows this in the results: .cards_tab_label

https://chime.sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:1debit+lang:ruby+%28.cards+AND+NOT+.cards%5BA-Z_%5D%29&amp;patternType=literal
### Application Engineer Answer
Okay, I believe I may have found a query that works for this.
Please try repo:1debit lang:ruby content:\.cards\b
I was taking a look at your query and hadn't noticed that you had literal search turned on :sweat_smile: .
Please swap this to regex and this should work out for you I believe even with your original query.
