## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Honestly, never got to understand what the customer was seeing. Ticket closed due to no-/low-response. But it was some sort of browser extension issue:

> " The only change I see is a link that goes to the repo(aka homepage) in SG. I cannot click on any keywords to start searching. "

### Troubleshooting Steps
Asked for screenshots + clarification. Also sent them the general documentation on the [browser extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension) , and a specifically linked them the sub-section on [troubleshooting](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension#troubleshooting) . 

### Resolution
None, really. Customer didn't get back to me/clarify their situation.
