## Summary
### Customer Question
> Hi all! What effect does setting `"allowGroupsPermissionsSync": true` in the GitHub auth config have? We have a few users reporting that they canâ€™t see their private repos in Sourcegraph, so trying to figure out the issue.


### Application Engineer Answer
> Setting `allowGroupsPermissionSync` in GitHub configuration is part of how Sourcegraph leverages cacheing for team and organization permissions, so it's unlikely to have any impact on personal, private repositories. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/repo/permissions#teams-and-organizations-permissions-caching) if you're curious.
>
> We are actually currently working on fine-tuning your instance to improve permissions syncing.


The customer confirmed that they don't use cacheing, so they set `allowGroupsPermissionsSync` back to false, which required a server restart of their managed instance. Jason handled that for me.

Gabe is currently looking into a permissions syncing issue with delivery here, and resolving that will likely handle this as well.
