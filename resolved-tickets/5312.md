## Summary
### Customer Question
"Is it preferable to run grafana customized version or could sourcegraph reference instead our shared instance?"

"It's not really clear what should be the value for GRAFANA_SERVER_URL?"

### Application Engineer Answer
Generically answered that it's best to just run whatever Sourcegraph packages, as "custom" or highly individualized infrastructures tend to run into unique issues.

Was unable to find a good answer regarding GRAFANA_SERVER_URL , and would probably need a colleague to answer/understand this. Fortunately, the question didn't come up again and the customer seemed okay with relinquishing their concern.
