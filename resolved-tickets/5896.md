## Summary
### Customer Question
How to setup repo groups and where to define them. 
### Application Engineer Answer
You can create a repogroup alias in your user settings using "search.repositoryGroups": {}

You'd define the URL's of the repositories in the group in the curly braces.This would look like:

"search.repositoryGroups": {
      "repoGroupName": [
          "excodehost.com/example/example_repo1"
          "excodehost.com/example/example_repo2" 
          "excodehost.com/example/example_repo3"
    ], 
},
