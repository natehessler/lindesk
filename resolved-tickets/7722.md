## Summary
### Customer Question
We can not inspect into the org/repo repo. content:updateMessageCounters Exist in there, but when we try to look up for it in sourcegraph in a global context we find nothing. We need to specify the the repo like this in order to find content. repo:org/repo content:updateMessageCounters 

### Application Engineer Answer
It looks like the repo is a fork and results in repository forks are excluded by default (as well as archived repos). The ‘Some results excluded’ button will show search suggestions or limits being applied.
