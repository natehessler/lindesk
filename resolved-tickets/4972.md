## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

Customer repos weren't being automatically synced after a period of time

### Troubleshooting Steps

(Alex Video call)

### Resolution

gitserver was experiencing a disk usage of about 89% but did not fire off a critical alert to the customer letting them know that their disk space was less than 15%


Sourcegraph did not delete the least used clones and instead decided to not update a repository with the latest commits for 9 days at the time of this issue being reported.
