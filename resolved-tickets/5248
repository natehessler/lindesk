## Summary

### Customer Question

Should the builtin auth method be disabled if you'd like to authorize and authenticate with GitHub
### Application Engineer Answer

I would advise not to disable/remove the builtin authn provider since as the site admin you'd want to have a way to be able to login and administrate your instance in case of any outage/error on GitHub OAuth. Setting allowSignup to false allows you to create user accounts instead of allowing the user to create their own as I think is the case when the users try to sign in through GitHub.
 
Lastly, Okta can be used as a SAML auth method by itself, more on that here on this doc.
From what I understand, please correct me if I'm mistaken, is that you'd like to have users sign in to Okta and have GitHub permissions pulled from the app as they sign in to Sourcegraph.
 
Since we already support authn and authz through GitHub, I would assume you would like to have GitHub as an app in Okta such that the user first signs into Okta first then gets authenticated to GitHub and as such can sign in using GitHub on Sourcegraph.
