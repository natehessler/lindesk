## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Getting the following error when checking out a dashboard for a set of insights:

`ExpandCaptureGroupSeriesJustInTime for seriesiD: 294mWsUfPLq0CPACn7QoAQjsLIJ: CaptureGroupExecutor.Execute: FirstEverCommit: git command [rev-list --reverse --date-order --max-parents=0 HEAD] failed (output: ""): exit status 129 `

### Troubleshooting Steps

TLDR: Empty repositories (0 commits) are not handled in an insight.

Process:
I combed through their logs. I think `repo-updater`, specifically? I forget ðŸ˜¬ But I searched for `git command [rev-list --reverse --date-order --max-parents=0 HEAD]`, or some sub-string of it.

One of the errors that included both (a) the aforementioned `git command...` search-term and (b) one of the repos mentioned for the dashboard, was an empty repo. I believe I was able to get a hint that this repo was empty by using search-contexts (I think search contexts reported that it didn't have a `main` branch, or something), but ultimately, the customer had confirmed that the repo was empty.

Turns out this is semi-expected... Insights don't handle completely empty repositories (0 commits). However, the UI is not consistent between Insight types. This is best illustrated by the filed [GitHub issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/35450).

### Resolution
Public issue filed. Customer satisfied. Empty repository removed from their Insight.
