## Summary
### Customer Question
How exactly would I search for this string:
```react-query@^3.34.5:```
in a specific file in Sourcegraph?
### Application Engineer Answer
Ah! I think I've found a hypothesis to test out here.

Just a feeling I have here is that we may have hit an issue with searching a large lock file potentially due to the fact that it could be larger than 1MB.
Sourcegraph has it indexed, that's why we can open it but we aren't able to search for content in it.

I think we may have to double check with a Site Admin, (@esit,I believe) whether we have this config in the site.

Ideally, this could look like:

"search.largeFiles": [
            "go.sum",
            "package-lock.json",
            "yarn.lock"
        ],
as an example.

My hypothesis is that this could be missing in your site configuration which explains why I am able to search through a similar query across all lock files.
