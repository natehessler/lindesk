## Summary
### Customer Question

Hi.

I currently have this json for a code repo as an extsvc.json file that I map into docker-compose.yaml:

```
{
  "GITLAB": [
      {
          "url": "https://gitlab.com",
          "token": "${gitlab_token}",
          "authorization": {
              "identityProvider": {
                  "type": "oauth"
              }
          },
      "projectQuery": [
        "groups/xxx/projects?include_subgroups=yes&archived=yes&visibility=public",
        "groups/dxxxx/projects?include_subgroups=yes&archived=yes&visibility=private",
        "groups/dxxx/projects?membership=true&archived=no&include_subgroups=true&visibility=internal"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
The display name defaults to GITLAB #1.  I would like to set the display name for this repository so when I add more repositories it is clear which instance of GitLab this is indexing.  I have read the source code and it appears that there is an option of displayName in the shema:

`repo:^github\.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph$@b7ebb90 file:^cmd/frontend/graphqlbackend/schema\.graphql`

But my json skills are not quite good enough to be able to work out how to add the displayName to extsvc.json – please can you help?!

### Application Engineer Answer
We currently don't have a way to edit the `displayName` in the `extsvc.json` file. This is not supported because the property `displayName` is not allowed.
If you also take a look at the [github.schema.json](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/external_service/github#configuration), you see that `displayName` is not among the supported configuration options.
I also attempted to do this via the GraphQL API and I got the following feedback:
`Adding external service not allowed when using EXTSVC_CONFIG_FILE`


However, I have a workaround for you to use. The `displayName`  can be modified in the database, you just need to exec into the Postgres container and run the following query:

`SELECT * FROM external_services; //this allows you get the displayName you want to rename and get its corresponding id`

`update external_services SET display_name = '<newname>' where id = <idnumber>; //allows you to rename the displayName`

The above query worked for me as I was able to change the `displayName`.
