## Summary

### Customer Question
I have a problem running the src batch preview command.

Looks like the search found some repos that have been archived, I would like to see if there is an option to ignore such an error.


### Application Engineer Answer
We have the -skip-errors flag that will skip the repository causing errors without stopping the execution of the batch spec.
