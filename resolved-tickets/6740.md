## Summary
### Customer Question
I ran a search with the API console for GraphQL and it came back with limitHit as true. I understand there's a limit to how many results you can retrieve at once, but how do I get the remaining results?

### Application Engineer Answer
Adding count:all to your query will remove result limits.
