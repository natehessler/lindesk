## Summary
### Customer Question
Now that the codeinsights-db is just regular PostgreSQL and not using the timescaledb, any concerns with us replacing it with an RDS PostgreSQL instance? 

### Application Engineer Answer
Code Insights should be good to use with a managed database now that timescaledb has been deprecated on 3.39.0.
