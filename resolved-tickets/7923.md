## Summary
### Customer Question
I'm trying to disable the rank-by-star feature for codebases by following these instructions: <br />
"Search results across repositories are now ordered by repository rank by default. By default the rank is the number of stars a repository has. An administrator can inflate the rank of a repository via experimentalFeatures.ranking.repoScores. If you notice increased latency in results, you can disable this feature by setting experimentalFeatures.ranking.maxReorderQueueSize to 0." (link here<https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/29856>)
so that's what I did by setting the following in the config files:
```
"experimentalFeatures": {
"ranking": {
"maxReorderQueueSize": 0
}
}
```
but that doesn't seem to be working ie the search results are still ranked by stars. Any idea why that may be?
### Application Engineer Answer
I recommended they restart their instance with `kubectl rollout restart deployment sourcegraph-frontend` or `kubectl rollout restart deployment -n <namespace>`. Customer reported no change in search results but stopped responding to my follow up messages so I suspect the issue is resolved/likely needed more time to reflect the config change
