## Summary
### Customer Question
Does the scip-typescript index command work for projects that are a mix of Ruby & Javascript?
### Application Engineer Answer
Hey
@adam
I just got confirmation that for a bi-lingual or multi-lingual project/repo, you’d have to run indexes for both(scip-typescript index and scip-ruby index) — this will generate two indexes, both of which would need  to be uploaded for precise code intel.
