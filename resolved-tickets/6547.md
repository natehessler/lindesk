## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue

(Context: Batch changes)

> He's still seeing an issue where the PRs open just fine, but subsequent syncs fail. There's an error message about token scopes, but his token is stored in his personal settings and has the correct scopes (I watched him make it). **** suggested this might be a code host rate limit issue, and setting up Batch Change webhooks might help if so, but it might have another root cause. (****  would be the [person] to set up the webhook if we go that route.)

### Troubleshooting Steps
(Asked for logs, but that's it. Didn't even get them nor look at them. Looking back, webhooks seemed like the best recommendation.)

### Resolution
Webhooks set up, and everything seemed to had gotten fixed. Wooooooo \\( 'o' )/
