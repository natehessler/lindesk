## Summary
### Customer Question
a user trying to run this search is receiving an error. I am able to run other searches fine. Is there something that needs to be changed syntactically for this search to work or is there an issue?
https://sourcegraph.indeed.tech/search?q=context:global+DRAW+Synthetic+Test+Monitor&patternType=literal 
```
1 error occurred:
no searcher endpoints could be found (this may indicate more searcher replicas are needed, contact support@sourcegraph.com for assistance)
```

### Application Engineer Answer
Increasing the number of searcher replicas should take care of this error. While Indeed has a managed instance, this error is on their on-prem instance so they should be able to increase it on their end. Customer was concerned about why some searches lead to this error while others are performed fine -- that comes down to indexed vs non-indexed which are performed by zoekt and searcher respectively.
