## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
This initially started as a How to, with the customer asking how to properly index a repo. 

### Troubleshooting Steps
Checked the queue in pgsql for the repo in question, which wasn't there. confirming that the repo was never set to index in the first place.
Determined that while a private repo, several other private/internal repos were indexing.
Tried manually adding the repo in question to the code host config. Repo still not showing up.


### Resolution
They had a generic github user that needed read permissions to the repo.
