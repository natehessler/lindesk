## Summary
### Customer Question

Looking into our alerts. Looks like the repo-updater warning is quite persistent, although we definitely are syncing our monorepo. Why is this metric inaccurate?

### Application Engineer Answer

Hey @jmeador that alert is actually just inaccurate -- we have an open issue of it and run into it fairly commonly. It's currently listed as a high priority bug for our relevant internal team.
