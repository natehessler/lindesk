## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Customer received this error:

Sourcegraph encountered an unexpected error. If reloading the page doesn't fix it, contact your site admin or Sourcegraph support.
Unable to fetch repo revisions
### Troubleshooting Steps
Checked with the customer whether gc.auto 0 is enabled

Can you exec into the gitserver directory for this repo and run git prune and git fetch ?
Let's take note of errors here. You can slack them over to me.
We can try to fix the repo with git gc and re-running git fetch again.
### Resolution
Final update for the week (I hope):  git gc  again returned some invalid objects. I did another round of cleaning. Seems there's still an issue lingering; will plan for a fresh clone in the near future.
For now: Have a great weekend. Thanks for your prompt support,
