## Summary

### Customer Question

Is there an extension to see the base and head branch in sourcegraph

### Application Engineer Answer

No, not really, but the "compare" view might satisfy their requirement.

As mentioned in the thread between the application engineer and the client:

> You might be able to see something similar by going to a similar URL, probably formed something like <your sourcegraph domain>.<your repository path>/-/compare/<branch1>...<branch2>

And another example: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/compare
