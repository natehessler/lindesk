## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

The customer posed a question about constructing a query to generate a list of repositories with open source licenses and whether or not Sourcegraph Cloud would return a data set that large.



### Troubleshooting Steps

I consulted the documentation located here: https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/reference/queries
I explained to the customer that only 2.1 million starred Github repositories have been indexed so far so the results are limited to whatever is in that data set.
I explained the UI limitations of displaying all possible search results and explained that using the Sourcegraph CLI tool would display all the results without the bottleneck of UI limitations.
I offered a possible query solution to the customer.
