## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue:  After upgrading to v3.32 the customer finds that their instance no longer has access to their custom coverage extension

### Troubleshooting Steps:  

### Resolution:  Steps can be found in the linked github issue
Essentially an update to our extensionId discovery isn't honoring the extension naming conventions. So you can temporarily get around this by adding your extension manually in your global site config.
From the linked issue:
```
# naming schema
[registry|host]/publisher/name

# example name
sourcegraph.company.com/alex/myextension
```
