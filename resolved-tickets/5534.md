## Summary
### Customer Question
Which datastore stores the application configuration?

### Application Engineer Answer
Most parts of Sourcegraph’s configuration are managed in the web app via text editors. These files are typically stored in the Postgres database but are translated into text for editing in the web UI.
You can get more info [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/migrate-backup#option-2-all-postgres-data) to find out more on data stored in the postgres DB
