## Summary
Submitting this summary without resolution. The problem magically disappeared, but the backup instance shows an unhealthy status on the symbols service. My closing suggestion to the customer:
 
'...I think we should go ahead and close out this issue with the following caveat: Let's keep an eye on the backup instance, specifically the symbols service for anything worse than an unhealthy status. You might try restarting the entire instance, rather than just the symbols service and see if that kicks things back into gear for the backup instance. When the symptoms return, please make a new post, and we'll go from there with fresh logs. Ultimately, I do think something wonky is going on, but I'd like to wait to continue this until you're actively experiencing these symptoms again when it will be easier to debug.'
