## Summary
### Customer Question
> We would like be able take the metrics, dashboards, and alerts from the Sourcegraph internal prometheus and grafana and put them into our own promtheus/grafana?


### Application Engineer Answer
> In general, we recommend against consuming Sourcegraph's metrics in an external system, since those metrics and thresholds can change across releases - you can read about that in more detail [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/faq#can-i-consume-sourcegraph-s-metrics-in-my-own-monitoring-system-datadog-new-relic-etc).
> 
> You'll also find in that linked page the fact that we recommend making use of [Prometheus federation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/) when there are multiple monitoring systems that support Prometheus scraping in play.
