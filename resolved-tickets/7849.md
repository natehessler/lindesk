## Summary
### Customer Question
I’m trying to create a search context based on a query and added "experimentalFeatures.searchContextsQuery": true to my settings, but I still can’t find the “Create context” button as mentioned in the docs (we’re on 3.36.2 so should have this).
Am I missing something? or should this be enabled by the admins first?
### Application Engineer Answer
@roee.zolantz I think you may have to first enable search contexts first in your experimental settings.
Your settings config should look something like:
"experimentalFeatures": {
    "showSearchContext": true,
    "searchContextsQuery": true
},
Please give this a try.
