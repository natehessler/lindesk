## Summary
### Customer Question

what about when the query has a space in it?


### Application Engineer Answer

Hello again! From what I gathered, white space sort of depends. For example, if the search is literal, spaces separate search terms.
Whereas in regex search, spaces between non-whitespace strings is converted to .*? to create a fuzzy search. And the \ escapes the space and treats the space as part of the pattern. Also, this page has some more information on the structure of searches. I hope that helps!
