## Summary
### Customer Question

After upgrading our QA Sourcegraph cluster to 3.35.1, we started triggering the following alert:



`[CRITICAL] frontend: 2s+ 90th percentile page load latency over all routes over 10m`



This appears to be new and we can't view the documentation on this at the moment. 
Looking at the logs for the frontend pods does reveal repeated errors around a missing route:



`API no route: POST /.internal/saved-queries/list-all from`



### Application Engineer Answer

We removed query-runner in 3.35, but we are seeing some customers still have it deployed due to Kustomize overlays which are overriding 
the removal of the base manifest.

Query runner should be removed from deployment if customer is 3.35 or higher. It causes frontend latency and the failed calls that the customer reported.
