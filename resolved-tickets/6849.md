## Summary
### Customer Question
> Hi, currently the Sourcegraph browser plugin allows to navigate from a GitHub diff to the code index, e.g. you can click on a function call and can drill into it in SG. Is such an integration also planned for Gerrit?


### Application Engineer Answer
That functionality was already built into the browser extension, it was just a matter of getting things configured so that repos cloned via `ssh` were saved to the database with a name that the extension would be able to find through the GraphQL API. We were able to accomplish this by making use of the `repositoryPathPattern` property in code host configuration.
