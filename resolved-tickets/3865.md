## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue:  URL Mismatch when adding redirect URL to sourcegraph extension

### Troubleshooting Steps: 
1. user installs extension
2. user goes to set up extension, sees that it wants the sourcegraph url
3. user types in https://sourcegraph.example.com
4. user gets redirected silently to https://sourcegraph.example.com/search
5. user copies https://sourcegraph.example.com/search and pastes it into sourcegraph extension
6. extension shows green check mark; happy days
7. user clicks “find references” on something
8. generated URL includes /search  where it should not
9. user gets an error message about “no repo found” because the URL translated into repo:^search/something because of the extra prefix.
10. user is confused, comes to ask for help
11. we figure out that /search doesn’t need to be there
12. user removes the /search
