## Summary
### Customer Question
I want to search non-archived reference of AnnotatedCompositeSerializer , this is my search AnnotatedCompositeSerializer archived:no lang:java and I got this reference from the 4th result. But app owner confirmed that this repo was archived. Can you let me know if my search is correct?

### Application Engineer Answer
We get the ‘archived’ status by checking the “archived” label on the repo. Does this repo have the ‘archived’ label applied on BB?
