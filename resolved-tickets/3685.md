## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

This was an inquiry regarding the nature of java-lsif. The inquiry involved the fact that the customer was using a custom java build system in which repos did not contain all of their build dependencies within the scope of their .git and thus couldn't be built via the automated lsif-java index command



### Resolution
A call was organized with Olaf from code-intel in which it was clarified that via the custom build documentation SAPs build system could indeed be configured to run lsif-java during their CI's build pipeline.
