## Summary
### Customer Question

This was ultimately stumbling blocks in getting Sourcegraph set up. Misconfig and lack of resources to pods.

### Application Engineer Answer

They accidentally tried to externalize the Code Insights DB. It cannot be run externally because its a timescale DB.
3.35.0 Has problems with Code Insights - we let them know and they switched install to 3.35.1
PVs were lingering from previous attempts to start the product
Lack of resources to pods - needed to use the resource calculator
