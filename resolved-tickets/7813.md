## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Error appears in UI when attempting to search

### Troubleshooting Steps
Observed logs for frontend and searcher
Reached out to engineering for debugging
We theorized that the IP allowlist might be root cause
We also considered that the container volume mounts might have been problematic

### Resolution
The customer never had the issue re-appear after initial presentation, and we resolved both potential root causes we had theorized.  Since the risk for this occurring again is very low, we are closing
