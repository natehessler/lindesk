## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Query that used to work no longer does after a version upgrade, with error messages citing `must be authenticated as user with` issues.  However, when removing `monitors` from the query, it works.

### Troubleshooting Steps
Leading off of the `authenticated` message && combining that with the fact that the query used to work but did not after a version upgrade, I checked the [CHANGELOG](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/CHANGELOG)  for any security issues. Saw that there were some, shared with customer.

At the same time, also filed an [RFH](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/750) 

### Resolution
It is a known [issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/31321) , and will be fixed eventually!
