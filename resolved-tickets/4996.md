## Summary

### Customer Question
> Hi, one question regarding the usage data: Under the Usage stats and Monthly data, I can only see counts tracking back to this October. Is the 3-month window caused by auto-deletion of old data or something else?


### Application Engineer Answer
> Hey Kevin, I did some digging into this and found that the 3 month window is the result of a default settings that are used by the function involved in querying this info. I probed a little into the database and found that this info looks like its being coalted from the event_logs table in pgsql. I was looking for an easy way to query the database for more info on this but it doesn't seem like an easy task. Hope that helps to answer your questionWhile I was investigating this, I saw that its a fairly common feature request/product gap. We can certainly file another request here if you'd like to be able to review further back in the usage stats
