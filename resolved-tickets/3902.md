## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue:  
The Customer was unable to start Sourcegraph Development Server.


### Troubleshooting Steps:  
ask the user for the output of ``go env`` to know the go version, if it’s not the same that we’re telling people to use in the docs, that’s an immediate red flag.
Found out the output of ```CTAGS_COMMAND=cmd/symbols/universal-ctags-dev go build -o .bin/symbols github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/cmd/symbols```. Which version of docker-compose he was running. Until we fix that with automated checks, I think those are the two questions we ought to ask community members when they come to us with build failures on sg start.



### Resolution:  
The customer is running an old version of Docker-compose.


### Relevant Error / Logs:  

<!-- Please redact keys, tokens, and personal identifying information -->

```error: failed to run symbols```
```error: failed to build symbols```
