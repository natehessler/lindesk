## Summary
### Customer Question

A customer observed that hover tooltips weren't working for go generics on lsif indexed repos

### Application Engineer Answer

After a brief review of our github issues internally I found that indeed we haven't yet developed lsif that covers generics, notified code-intel to help them identify and prioritize 

See GitHub issues:
