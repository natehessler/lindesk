## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue:  Code Intelligence Question
### Troubleshooting Steps:  
1. Explained to the customer that our Sourcegraph Cloud product has already done the work of indexing the public Kubernetes repository. 
2. Explained that a private instance of Sourcegraph is not going to come with the precise code intelligence functionality that they are requesting.
### Resolution:  
Directed the customer to add the Kubernetes public repository to their private Sourcegraph instance.
Informed the customer of cross-repository code intelligence functionality as documented [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence/explanations/precise_code_intelligence#cross-repository-code-intelligence).
Informed the customer about manually indexing the Kubernetes public repository if the code intelligence did not resolve by referencing the documentation [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence/tutorials/indexing_go_repo).
