## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

The customer was unable to access repositories with an organization scope on Sourcegraph. The customer was able to access the repositories on their Github instance, however.


### Troubleshooting Steps

The customer was asked to search for their organization's public repositories by using the search query repo:github to test their Sourcegraph permissions.
The customer was able to see the organization's public repositories and it was determined at this moment that the customer was experiencing a bug documented in the already-filed Github issue.



### Resolution
The customer was given access to a team within the Github organization. The team scope is not experiencing any known permission syncing issues within Sourcegraph currently.
