## Summary

### Customer Question

Is there a way to turn on "per line blame" like GitHub has?


### CSE Answer

Hi Jon, that can be done by clicking on the git extra extension icon til you see the following pop-up where it says it will display git blame for the whole file (see attached pictures for examples). I hope this answers your question!
