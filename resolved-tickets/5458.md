## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue

The customer was getting the following error when searching:
"The connection was closed before your search was completed. This may be due to a problem with a firewall, VPN or proxy, or a failure with the Sourcegraph server."


### Troubleshooting Steps
- Requested for frontend logs
- checked to see if all the pods are healthy.
- Asked if there were any changes to the pgsql.

### Resolution
Running kubectl-apply-all.sh didn't apply the updated sourcegraph-frontend role and force applying the role seems to have fixed the issue.
