Hi ,

I was trying to use the source graph provided in the email link. I was using the continue with github option as I tried the username and password didn’t work. Upon selecting the option I have been landed on “Authorize Source Branch” . And the below screen.
Is that I should be allowing the access ..Am I doing it correct ?

### Application Engineer Answer
​
​Hello!

What you are seeing is the typical sign-in flow for Sourcegraph when using GitHub as an authentication provider.

What you are seeing is the result of your Sourcegraph Site Admin following these instructions:

https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/auth#github

https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app

"SourceBranch" is the name that your Site Admin has given to your Sourcegraph instance at sourcegraph.amd.com.

"AMD-Radeon-Driver" is the GitHub user or organization that created the GitHub app "SourceBranch".

You should authorize AMD-Radeon-Driver and you will be signed into Sourcegraph using GitHub.
