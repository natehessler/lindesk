## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue
This was a hacktober fest open source setup question. In particular the user encountered troubles starting up the db
1) The customer attempted to initialize and access the database from inside a vscode terminal which docker does not have access to by default
2) The user had not installed postgres and redis on their local system
3) Various instructions were required to troubleshoot initializing the local database



### Troubleshooting Steps
Attempt to get psql running locally and follow error trails. 



### Resolution

The user reinstalled postgres and followed the correct procedure to initialize a local database. They also under advisement ceased to use the vscode terminal to run containerized dbs
