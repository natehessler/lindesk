## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer asked how to access usage statistics.

### Application Engineer Answer
Turns out customer was not a site-admin, which is a pre-requisite for accessing usage statistics.

> That is extremely odd. My very first question would be: Is Hugo, in fact, a Site-Admin for this deployment? If not, that would be the reason why they cannot access the "Site-Admin" button in the usual dropdown menu.
>
> Hugo, if you happen to have access to the deployment itself, and by extension, the pgsql service/database, you can check if you show up in the query for select * from users where site_admin=true to determine if you currently do or do not have Site-Admin access.
>
> Just for illustrative purposes, here are two screenshots of the dropdown menu of a non-Site-Admin, and a Site-Admin. Note that one has "Site Admin" in the dropdown, the other does not. The presence/absence of this button is expected to be an accurate reflection of that account's privileges.
