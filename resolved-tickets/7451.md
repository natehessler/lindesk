## Summary
### Customer Question
How do I return content of files from a stream search without using src?

### Application Engineer Answer
you have to trick the API into returning the file contents by using select: content then using the regex for select everything .*. i.e.:

src search -stream "r:sourcegraph/sourcegraph file:.yml select:content .* count:all patternType:regexp
