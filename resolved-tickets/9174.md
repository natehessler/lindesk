## Summary
### Customer Question
Is possible to make a batch change dependent on another batch change that has already been merged to a given repo?

### Application Engineer Answer
At this moment, this is not possible.
However, this would be considered for a Feature Request.
Users can always script around this (Sourcegraph has a comprehensive API), and it would still be 99% less work than doing all of this manually, but it's not part of the core product.
