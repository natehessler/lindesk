## Summary

### Customer Question

can you help me coming up with a regex that will also filter out commented lines? i am searching in java-environment, so any line starting with // will be counted as a commented line. the // can be preceded by any number of whitespaces, but nothing else.
here is the original regex that i'd like to tune:


### Application Engineer Answer

This pattern (?! is currently not supported by Sourcgeraph but I found a rough workaround for their use, which is:


if we can safely assume the match string is at least n characters from the start of the line
and that there won’t be other / preceding matches in matching lines either

we can do something like ^[^\/]{n} and it’ll ignore any line with a / in the first n chars
