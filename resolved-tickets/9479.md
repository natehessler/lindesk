## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
On every first run of `src batch preview` it generates an error msg, each subsequent execution is correct. 
### Troubleshooting Steps

### Resolution
- I think this is most likely related to docker taking a while to get started and up and running to process these batch changes.
- Increasing the Docker CPU allocation
