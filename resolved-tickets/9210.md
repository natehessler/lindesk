## Summary
### Customer Question
Is it possible to setup having double auth system? 1 is github auth and 2 is builtin. I thought some UI for users can select login method. In case of github, user can select “Sign in with SAML” or  “Sign in with a username and password”.

### Application Engineer Answer
Sourcegraph supports username/password auth by default. We support both authentication and permissions syncing (through OAuth) for GitHub. However, If you use GitHub as your code host, we do not officially support using another authentication mechanism (SAML, etc.). Instead, you’ll need to follow this flow:
Use SAML (or another auth mechanism) to log in to GitHub
Use GitHub OAuth to log in to Sourcegraph

In this way, access to Sourcegraph will still be managed by your identity provider, using the code host as a middle step.
Follow these steps to [configure authentication with GitHub via OAuth](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/auth#github). For more information on Authorization in Sourcegraph you can reference this [doc](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/config/authorization_and_authentication#built-in-username-password-authentication)
