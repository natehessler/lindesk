## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The Dashboard dropdown on the code insights page was not opening. 

### Troubleshooting Steps
We confirmed the data was there, by removing the CSS sheets in the browser console. The issue was the way the CSS sheets were being loaded in the customer's instance.

### Resolution
We noticed the customer was using the option htmlHeadTop to insert a div into the head tag. This was causing the head to close early and the rest of the style sheets were loaded into the body, causing CSS conflicts.
