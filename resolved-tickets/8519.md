## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer wants a script to help remove inactive user accounts
### Application Engineer Answer
I believe in general, writing a script for a customer is outside the scope of support but there is a script available for deleting users, found here: https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C02MA9RQWMD/p1637188514002800?thread_ts=1637187964.002100&cid=C02MA9RQWMD
<br /> The customer is going to use the cleanup script to delete user accounts that have been inactive for the past 200 days.
