## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer was testing their ability to complete Batch Changes on one of their development machines, an M1 Macbook. Running `batch apply` failed with an error from the docker daemon: `invalid mount config for type "bind"`...`transport endpoint is not connected`. This, fortunately, did not have any impact on their production, as they handle that on different machines and have been able to apply Batch Changes without any difficulty in that context.
 
### Troubleshooting Steps
Initial [research](https://toolspond.com/fix-transport-endpoint-is-not-connected/) indicated that the transport endpoint is not connected element of the error is something that can often be resolved just by rebooting the computer or unmounting the virtual file system for a while.  I asked them to try applying the Batch Change again, just to make sure the error was consistent.

The error was not consistent! With the second attempt, it made it further before getting stuck on one of their repos.
 
### Resolution
I reached out to the Batch Changes team, who were able to confirm that the initial error was a bug in Docker Desktop for Mac, but the second was something they'd seen before and, unfortunately, have not found a way to prevent yet. 

I pointed the customer toward Server-side Batch Changes as an experimental workaround, and passed along some commands from the Batch Changes team to confirm that this was, in fact, the same bug they had seen before. The customer thanked me for the update, and, at time of writing, has not reported any further issues with Batch Changes hanging on a repo. They will be addressing the Docker Desktop for Mac bug with their support contact at Docker and are satisfied with how things have settled here.
