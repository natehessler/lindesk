## Summary
### Customer Question
- How often can we expect database migration issues, and how can we prevent them?
### Application Engineer Answer
- since version 3.38, we don't have any records of database migration issues in our solved ticket database.
- The addition of the Migrator service should dramatically reduce the occurence of database migrations issues
