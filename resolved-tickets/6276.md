## Summary
### Customer Question
Working through some of the info sec stuff, our gitlab team is claiming that they can only produce an admin token with ‘api’ and ‘sudo’ scopes. What’s the bare minimum we need for the token?

### Application Engineer Answer
An admin token with api and sudo permissions will suffice.
