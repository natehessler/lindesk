## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer was checking the monitoring for Sourcegraph and was wondering why less than 0 repositories synced for 9h0m0s would be firing. He spot-checked a few repos and they all had changes newer than 9 hours ago. he wanted to know if this is just a bug or something he needs to look into?
 
### Troubleshooting Steps
- Searched for previous error messages and I discovered its a bug.

### Resolution
This looks to be a known [bug]( https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/20911). 
To summarise, the metrics that track the repo-updater for grafana appear to be out of sync with the actual behavior of the repo-updater.
While our team investigates a fix for this, rest assured that alerts are inaccurate and your Sourcegraph instance is indeed syncing repos. 
If the alerts are a major annoyance there is an option to silence them [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/alerting#silencing-alerts).
