## Summary
### Customer Question
> qq @here what Deployment should we restart if we see a lot of repos that werent fetched in github?

Customer also reported an error:

```
t=2022-05-13T11:11:46+0000 lvl=eror msg="Syncing changeset" err="error in GraphQL response: Resource protected by organization SAML enforcement. You must grant your Personal Access token access to an organization within this business."
```

### Application Engineer Answer
Shared with the customer that `repo-updater`, and then maybe `git-server`, would be the appropriate services to restart, based on AER's reading of the [docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/background-information/architecture/life-of-a-repository#services)

Regarding the error: AER asked for how they resolved it, but they didn't respond with an answer. So maaaaybe they restarted it and it worked out, or they did some SAML stuff.
