## Summary
### Customer Question
While searching for something like above, can we enable regex and do (<first-query-string> | <second-query-string>) to search with and or statement right next to type:diff
### Application Engineer Answer
To answer your question, yes it's possible to do that using Boolean AND/OR operators in your search query. Building out with the type:diff filter(or any additional that you would like) as well is possible too, enabling you to take a look at different versions of files etc.I just did a sample query to share this with you here. Does this answer your question?
