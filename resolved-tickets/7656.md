## Summary
### Customer QuestionIs there a way for us to avoid having to manually maintain an explicit list of internal repos? Can you think of a way to tweak these lines:

  "repositoryQuery": [
    "org:Glovo type:internal"
  ],

To make Sourcegraph fetch only internal repos, without us having to write a whole new script maintaining an explicit list?


### Application Engineer Answer
"repositoryQuery": [
    "org:Glovo is:internal"
  ],
