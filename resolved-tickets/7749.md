## Summary
### Customer Question
> Hi team
>
> One engineer cannot see any private repositories in search results.
>
> I manuallly synced his permission but did not resolve the issue.


### Application Engineer Answer
The customer was able to solve the problem by manually deleting and recreating the engineer's account. I offered some guidance on how they might approach debugging if the issue came back, and have received no further communication.
