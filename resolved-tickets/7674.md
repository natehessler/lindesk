## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
customer reports single-container sourcegraph server instance crashes when executing a search

### Troubleshooting Steps
ask about instance scale
customer shares they have disabled search indexing

### Resolution
disabled search indexing forces all searches to go through Searcher instead of Indexed Search, which causes high RAM usage, causing the server to OOM.  Re-enabling search indexing allows searches to resolve as expected
