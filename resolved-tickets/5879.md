## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Hello! Previously, the src batch apply|preview commands would set the exit code if any of the individual specs failed. This was useful, because the batch would not be created and it would show up as a failure in our CI system.Now, I’m seeing that when an error is encountered, it shows up in the logs but the exit code is still 0 and the batch preview still gets created, just without any changesets in it.Is this a bug? Or is there a CLI flag that will cause the exit code to be set based on whether there were any errors?

### Troubleshooting Steps
I'd previously seen this behavior with another customer
