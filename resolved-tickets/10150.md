## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Customer users saw the following error when trying to login:
No user exists matching any of the verified emails:

First error was: User account with verified email "m*******@icloud.com" does not exist. Ask a site admin to create your account and then verify your email.

Also, one user tried to add a new email and got the following error:
SendUserEmailVerificationEmail: close: 554 Transaction failed: User name is missing: 'Sourcegraph'
### Troubleshooting Steps
This could also indicate an exhaustion of seats and or an issue with an account cleanup process. Glovo has now changed from a 4 week account cleanup timeline to 2 weeks. So the users accounts might have been deleted. 
### Resolution
Site admin created sign up links for affected users and also asked them to use their glovoapp emails.

The user who saw the SendUserEmailVerification, I asked to run the following in the API console.

query{
  currentUser{
    id
    username
  }
}


mutation{
  addUserEmail(user: "$your_user_id", email: "<mailto:david.cacenabes@glovoapp.com|david.cacenabes@glovoapp.com>"){
    alwaysNil
  }
}
