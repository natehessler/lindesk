## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue
A Sourcegraph Cloud customer had a request regarding their subscriptions. The customer had two subscriptions and they wanted to cancel one and change the other from auto-renewal to payment-on-invoice.



### Resolution
The finance team was able to process the requests for the customer. The CE team was able to generate a new license key as self-service auto-renewal license keys don't autogenerate.
