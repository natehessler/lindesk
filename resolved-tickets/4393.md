## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

The customer reported errors related to codeintel-db not being able to find a relation to schema_migratons. What was funny is that this table doesn't belong in the code intel db. 

### Troubleshooting Steps

Exec into pgsql and codeintel_db
Checked for dirty migrations
Checked for db corruption
Hopped onto a call to debug further and looked at logs

### Resolution

Turns out that this is an issue related to the customer using a dirty upgrade/deployment. In this case, the customer didn't use the standard practices of forking our deployment repo and fetching changes upstream. They have to do this manually and only grab the image tags and hence miss out on newly added lines on the manifest. Advised the customer to re-deploy Sourcegraph correctly for this purpose.
