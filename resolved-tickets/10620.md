## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Is it possible to list repos that match a query like this
`context:global count:1000 ((file:.drone.ya?ml$ codecov) and (file:infraspec.ya?ml$ team: delivery )) patternType:regexp`
If I change the `and` to a `or` in the above query, it works.


### Resolution
We're investigating some performance issues that might be affecting this query.  If you don't get results right now, it's simply a limitation and not anything you're doing wrong. The team is looking into this internally.
