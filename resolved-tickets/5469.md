## Summary
### Customer Question
The customer saw the error below.

```
export SOURCEGRAPH_VERSION=3.32
:~/git_hub_co/deploy-sourcegraph-docker$ git merge v$SOURCEGRAPH_VERSION
merge: v3.32 - not something we can merge
```


### Application Engineer Answer
The customer was trying to merge a tag that did not exist. I recommended using git tag to view the available versions. In this case "v3.32.0".
