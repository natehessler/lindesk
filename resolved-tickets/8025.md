## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Sourcegraph seems to have problems viewing vue files
### Troubleshooting Steps
Using customer query: lang: Vue export , I ran this on our public instance as well as our test instance.Initially, in my test instance, I got served with failed to fetch errors but upon refreshing, this cleared up and I was able to get results.What I have a strong hunch is happening is that, the syntax highlighter is unable to highlight the export term in your instance like in mine(see screenshot please) and that's why it's throwing those errors. It's the syntax highlighter that fails, not the search result highlighter. just opening one of those files with no search term to highlight leads to the same error
### Resolution
The issue resolved itself. There's no root cause finality due to the lack of vue support for code intelligence.
