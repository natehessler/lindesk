## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Case class "Find References" includes ALL case class definitions in precise code intelligence. This could have been due to the fix in #396 introducing this new bug.

### Troubleshooting Steps
An [rfh](https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-java/issues/399) was created.

### Resolution
The code intel team triggered a v0.7.6 release with the bugfixes for this issue and a few other case class-related issues (see [#401](https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-java/pull/401)). It may take a couple of hours for the artifacts to become available on Maven Central.
