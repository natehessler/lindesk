## Summary
### Customer Question
- How can I run a search across all branches of my repo?
### Application Engineer Answer
```
https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/reference/language#revision
This doc is useful as a comprehensive guide, but here are two quick examples:

Use rev search to target a specific tag or a branch:
https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+r:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+rev:v3.39.0&patternType=regexp

Use glob syntax to target all branches:
https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24%40*refs/heads/*+&patternType=literal
```
