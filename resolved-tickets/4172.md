## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

The customer wished to stop an applied Batch Change before the remaining repos were affected.



### Troubleshooting Steps

The customer attempted to set the published property of the previously applied batch change to false and then apply the batch change before the previous one was finished applying.
The customer inquired if there was a way to apply batch changes slowly over time.
The customer was informed of the global rollout window setting within Sourcegraph and given the following global rate suggestion: {"rate": "10/minute"} by Batcher Support.



### Resolution
The customer expressed that the suggested global rate configuration was a good solution.
