## Summary
### Customer Question

How hard is to to set up an AWS Code Commit provider for Sourcegraph to index?  Is that something that could be done in QA in a few hours?


### Application Engineer Answer

Looking at the docs it doesn’t look too difficult. It feels like a few hours is reasonable.

AWS code commit is not yet supported with the Sourcegraph browser extension.
