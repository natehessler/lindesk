## Summary
### Customer Question
when using ‘show references’ from the main window, it would show the references at the bottom, and when clicked on one of those, it displayed the result in the main (top window), now it opens a small window to the right of the references list. Is it configurable to use the old way?

### Application Engineer Answer
This is configurable in the User setting configuring `"basicCodeIntel.referencesPanel": "tabbed"` enables the old way.
Please note that the upcoming 4.1 release includes significant improvements to the new references panel, including the ability to click on a result to promote it directly to the top window
The above setting is only available in 4.0 and there is no way to turn it off in older versions.
