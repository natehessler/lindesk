## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Performance issues. Lots of OOM.


### Troubleshooting Steps
Look at grafana charts, which showed limited disk space remaining on the gitserver.
Also asked about other pods, all of which were underprovisioned.

### Resolution
This was a clear cut case of needing to add resources. They did so by following the recommendations of the resource estimator.
