## Summary
### Customer Question
> Does count mean the number of occurrences or number of files?

### Application Engineer Answer
`count:` will specify the number of matches to the pattern, which, by default, is occurences within a code-file. However, if say, the `select:` filter is used to specify to return only _files_, then the `count:` filter specifies the maximum number of _files_ to return.
