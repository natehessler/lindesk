## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer had questions about the types of results they were getting as references in some of their files. 
### Application Engineer Answer
The references can be either search-based or precise. Precise code intelligence relies on LSIF data to provide the kind of references you’re looking for. When this data is not available, sourcegraph falls back on search-based results, which are matches for the keyword.
<br /><br /> On the right side of the same line that has the “References” and “History” tabs there should be a button that says either Hide search-based results when precise results are available or Mix precise and search-based results. After clicking the “Hide” option, if you are still getting only search-based results then precise results are not available at this time.
