## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

The customer was seeing the following error when attempting to make a batch change:
Failed to run operations on changeset.
Creating commit from patch repository....pushing ref: exit status 128 

### Troubleshooting Steps

I moved my SSH keys in ~/.ssh to a different location so git won't use them.
I did unset SSH_AUTH_SOCK so gitserver won't access the keyagent that's still running on macOS
I started sg start

### Resolution

This turned out to be a bug that was broken from 3.27. Thorsten from batch changes helped with the fix.
