## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue:  The customer experienced an "auto-refresh" bug that was happening with an applied batch change with ~38,000+ changes. The customer did not have GitHub webhooks enabled at the time. 

### Troubleshooting Steps:  

I inquired if the customer had GitHub webhooks set up, they did not.
I asked for a screenshot of the github-proxy service from the Grafana dashboard.
I asked the customer to try opening the Batch Changes URL in the Safari browser and the error persisted.
I recreated the issue by applying 38,000+ changes in one batch change and found that memory issues occurred in both Safari and Chrome browsers but I did not experience the "auto-refresh" behavior that the customer experienced.
I communicated the inability to replicate to the customer and they communicated that they have not experienced the issue since but will be on the lookout if it occurs again.

### Resolution:  No resolution, inconclusive.

### Relevant Error / Logs:  N/A
