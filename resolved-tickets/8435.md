## Summary
### Customer Question
we are using a `docker-compose` setup. Do you know where I can find the logs of all containers and the service processes inside? I found some log messages are being written to `stdout/stderr`, and I can use the `docker log` command to get them. Can we config the Sourcegraph and writes the log to files? We are using Splunk to forward logs. Log files are easier to handle.

### Application Engineer Answer
I looked this up internally, And we don't have any official guidance or recommendations about specific log aggregators. I understand that some customers do use Splunk to ingest Sourcegraph logs. I believe the setup follows the general process to setup Splunk with any Docker-Compose application. If you decided to go that route, you may want to take a look at our log levels [doc](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/logs#log-levels) that describes the log output from Sourcegraph services and how to configure it. For Docker or [Docker-Compose](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/troubleshooting#examine-logs) deployments, logs are printed to `stdout` and `stderr`. You should be able to access these using your infrastructure provider’s standard log viewing mechanism.
