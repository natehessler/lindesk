## Summary
### Customer Question
> Hey Sourcegraph! I’ve looked through documentation but I would like to know if I’m missing anything. Is there a way to filter repositories based on Github Team or Tags?


### Application Engineer Answer
Filtering based on teams is not supported. We support filtering on tags/revisions, as described [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/reference/queries#repository-search). Not sure what "Tags" (capitalized) is though.
