## Summary
### Customer Question
If I try to access sourcegraph, it says:
Unable to create a user account: the Sourcegraph subscription's maximum user count has been reached. A site admin must upgrade the Sourcegraph subscription to allow for more users. Contact Sourcegraph at https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact/sales.

### Application Engineer Answer
You get this feedback when your sourcegraph subscription has reached its maximum user count. You can check in with your sourcegraph site admin to validate this and advice on next steps. Thanks
