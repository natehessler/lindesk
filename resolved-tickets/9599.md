## Summary
### Customer Question

This issue covers a request for the ability to view batch specs in the UI from users who have been removed from the Sourcegraph instance

### Application Engineer Answer

This is a known issue, but there's a few ways to get at the data

In the graphQL console
query {
  batchSpecs {
    nodes {
      id
      description {
        name
        description
      }
      originalInput
    }
  }
}


In the database
SELECT id,raw_spec FROM batch_specs WHERE user_id IS NULL;
