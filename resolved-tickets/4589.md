## GraphQL API Explorer- A query works just fine in the search bar but not using the GraphQL API Explorer



### Customer Question: Hi! I'm having issue with the GraphQL API Explorer. I have a query that works just fine in the search bar but fails to return results when using the API.

### Application Engineer Answer:



Client was using a regular expressions in both the content and repo portions of the query, but the. query string they are setting in the query variables object is missing patternType:regexp.

When you want to copy a query from the sourcegraph web UI into anything api/cli, you always want to use the official “copy to clipboard” button, just to the left of the search button.The highlighted blue button .* tells you that you’re using regular expression search instead of “literal” or “structural” search. The copy to clipboard button will inject the required modifiers into your query string.
