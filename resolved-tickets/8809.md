## Summary
### Customer Question
is the author of the PR going to be the same as the author of the commit or can it be specified independently? We would like to use a service account for creating the commit and possibly a different account for opening the PRs.
### Application Engineer Answer
You should be able to use the name and email fields under `changesetTemplate.commit` to specify who the commit appears under but the GitHub username tied to the PR will be that of the global service account user.
