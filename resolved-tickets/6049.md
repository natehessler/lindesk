## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Customer noticed a large increase in disk space over the past few days.
 
### Troubleshooting Steps
Asked for container usage statistics from the customer and noticed that the symbols service was sitting at 256G of usage which was too high.
 
### Resolution
Found a thread from earlier in the customer-support-internal channel pointing to an issue with the symbols service not deleting old cache files, which filled the disk quicker than usual. I informed the customer that this was the case and that a patch was forthcoming.
