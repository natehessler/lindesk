## Summary
### Customer Question
Does the order of external service config in a extsvc.json file effect how repos are synched? Can I remove excludes from my gitlab config and expect that repos produced on the gitlab code host by src serve git will not be recloned

### Application Engineer Answer

Order of code host config in an extsvc.json config doesn't matter, but, src serve git running on a codehost that's already synching via a separate code host config isn't well defined and could cause unknown bugs
