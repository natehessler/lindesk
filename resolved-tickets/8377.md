## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Find references do not pop up in shell scripts.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- I am also getting the same result you are seeing for `.sh` files.
- Found out if they are able to see the `find reference ` pop up for other files like go, java, js etc
- Yes, they are able to see this. 

### Resolution
I am able to reproduce this on `sh `files.  Search-based code intel is powered by the programming language extension by default. This extension comes with built-in code intelligence provided by [search-based heuristics](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence/explanations/search_based_code_intelligence). These heuristics do not work well for ambiguous tokens, such as `open` or `file etc`. So when trying to hover over a token, if the action `Go to definition` to go to the token's definition isn't available the `find reference`  action won't pop up. This explains the behavior with shell scripts.Although, I noticed you can get the `find reference` popup for [functions](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/enterprise/cmd/executor/image/build.sh) inside a shell script.
