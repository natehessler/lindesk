## Summary
### Customer Question
When I try to activate sourcegraph extension (using the private instance user option) with sourcegraph instance URL https://sg-instance.com/. It gives the output:
Unable to verify your access token for https://sg.instance.com/. Please try again with a new access token.

### Application Engineer Answer
Can you try adding the token and url to the json config?  
Navigate to Code , Preferences, then click Settings.  
Search for Sourcegraph.  
Add these settings:

```
"sourcegraph.url": "https://sg.instance.com/",
"sourcegraph.accessToken": "<access token>",
"sourcegraph.basePath": "/home/<username>/src/",
```
