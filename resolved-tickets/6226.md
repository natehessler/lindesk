## Summary
### Customer Question
A few issues: Customer was getting zero results from a search they knew should return _something_. Also wanted to know if there is a way to check that repos are getting updated and whether they can manually pull updates
### Application Engineer Answer
CE commented in the thread saying that they can manually pull updates using a webhook or by changing the auto repo update interval timer by changing repoListUpdateInterval in the site config. In regards to the zero search results, I asked them to confirm if there was a typo based on what I saw from the term being searched. It was!
