## Summary
### Customer Question
when creating a search context, is it possible to specify all revisions for a repository instead of specifying a list?

### Application Engineer Answer
I attempted a few tests around this and I discovered it currently not supported to use glob patterns to search over a range of revisions using a search context. You would have to specify them in an array, that way Sourcegraph can run a search across multiple revisions specified in the array.
