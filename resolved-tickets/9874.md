## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
My expectation is that `repo:stash.xxxx.com/.*` would give more results then `repo:stash.xxxx.com/J.*`

### Troubleshooting Steps
- I have requested for jaeger trace for the two different queries following the instructions [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/tracing).

### Resolution
The customer was on a very old version of sourcegrph (v3.34.2), After upgrading the instance it works correctly.
