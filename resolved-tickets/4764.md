## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue
The old secrets in the repo have been replaced with new ones but Sourcegraph search results still display the old secrets instead.



### Troubleshooting Steps

- checked to see if this happening across different repos or just a specific repo?

- asked for screenshots of the mirroring page of the affected repo, I would like to see when last the repo was synced and attempt to refresh by clicking the refresh button.


### Resolution
Took a while for the repo to sync probably due to its number in the update queue but the issue resolved itself as the repository was synced and is now updated.
