## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue

Customer was attempting to set up a POC of Sourcegraph using docker-compose locally -- they encountered networking errors with both connectivity issues to the database as well as network ports being in use 443

### Troubleshooting Steps

Jumped on call with the customer and observed their deployed containers using docker ps and just generally their workflow

Here I observed that the customer was attempting to initialize the instance within the vscode terminal. Historically this has caused issues for customers attempting to initialize the pgsql database, which is path dependent, and will sometimes encounter issues with the default VScode terminal path

### Resolution

On call I observed that the customer was attempting to initialize the instance within the vscode terminal. Historically this has caused issues for customers attempting to initialize the pgsql database, which is path dependent, and will sometimes encounter issues with the default VScode terminal path

I also observed that the admin was running a kubernetes control plane along side Sourcegraph on the host machine. After the admin stopped running the kubernetes control plane the issue was resolved. 

this also required clearing the old volumes and network which were initialized incorrectly docker volume prune
