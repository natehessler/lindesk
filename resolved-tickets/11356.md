## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Question: Does the archive made by src batch changes include tags or other git information?

### Resolution
Unfortunately, no. The way src-cli does this (by creating a git repo locally, is just an internal implementation detail. It doesn't contain anything but a single commit with all the upstream data. So no tags here. No original history at all. It's just a copy of the latest file tree. Unfortunately, given the above, what you're trying to do won't work only by using the workspace. The suggestion from the Batch Changes team is that you could try to fetch the tag from the upstream repo by either hitting the Bitbucket API, doing a fetch into a tmp directory, or something similar.
