## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
- Their security team deleted the IAM role which had the EBSCSIDriver policy that prevented the replicas from scaling back up. It got deleted from not being used 
- This prevented them from rolling back their instance when they ran into issues with their upgrade.
### Troubleshooting Steps
- After fixing the issue with their security team, they were able to get their instance running on the old version.
- We attempted the drift check again to make sure their DB is in the expected schema before the upgrade, we found some differences and corrected that.
- We did a dry-run to validate that the schemas are up to date.
- We eventually ran through the upgrade successfully and all migrations were complete.

### Resolution
After fixing the issue with their AWS permission and making sure their DB is in the expected schema Meli were able to upgrade their instance.
