## Summary
### Customer Question

Hi Sourcegraph support!I am from Security Intelligence team, and investigating an incident and in need of access logs for SourceGraph. I was in contact with @rene as well.
We need to get a copy the access logs for SourceGraph since 2022-05-09T00:00:00Z.  If I understand correctly, you will need to provide some instructions for our KITT team to use admin access into the KITT namespace to pull the access logs out of kubernetes. 

### Application Engineer Answer

Gotcha, the web UI doesn't present any access credentals for kubectl so we should be good on that front.There is a UI available to admins to look at a users actions/pages visited on Sourcegraph, but to my understanding a database dump of event_logs associated with a user is probably more in line with what you're after. I'll need to look into the correct query to run here to get you this data.In the meantime a user with admin access on your Sourcegraph instance can view a users usage events at this page https://$DOMAIN-NAME/users/$USER/settings/event-log (screenshot attached) -- unfortunately this is just a list with ordering options. SQL queries will probably be much more useful.
