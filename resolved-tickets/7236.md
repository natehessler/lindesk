## Summary
### Customer Question
> Hi all, I’m making some configuration changes and seeing this message: `Server restart is required for the configuration to take effect`. Is there a way that I can trigger a server restart or can someone help with that? Thank you!


### Application Engineer Answer
I asked Kelvin to restart their frontend pods, since he has access to the customer's managed instance.
