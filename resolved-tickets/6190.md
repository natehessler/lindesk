## Summary
### Customer Question
Structural Search: how do I search for a class with a parent class? This seems to be highlighting everything, not just the class definition.  

I've also tried:
• class :[class_name] &lt; :[parent_class]

### Application Engineer Answer
Answered by Rijnard: So the thing is, in Ruby, blocks of expressions are delineated by keywords like module ... end (similar to how you'd delineate blocks in other languages using { ... } ). In Comby, your patterns need to be valid for that language, so if you tried to write a pattern like { ... it wouldn't match in a language where braces are always expected to be balanced and well-formed. The same goes for block keywords in Ruby. So the answer to your question is: add the end keyword in the places where you'd like the block to stop matching: bit.ly/3oElKDI  

and (module :[namespace])* class :[class] ... end (end)* isn't a thing, right?  
nope, but you can submatch on nested blocks with rules https://comby.dev/docs/advanced-usage#pattern-match-expressions  
unfortunately no, there's no way to highlight just capture groups. we're working on more general purpose tooling that will let you extract any/all of this though
