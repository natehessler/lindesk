## Summary

### Customer Question


Is there any way to give the src client a list of dump files? (The customer is referencing LSIF files here)

### CSE Answer


The customer was directed to the documentation below on how to go about this. The customer ultimately was not able to use the documentation for their particular use case. This culminated in a Product Gap being filed in Salesforce by the assigned CSE.
