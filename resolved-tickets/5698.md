## Summary
### Customer Question

The customer was not able to clone any repos into Sourcegraph. The customer has a self-managed GitLab instance that requires an internally signed SSL certificate in order to be accessed. 

### Application Engineer Answer

The customer was able to successfully clone repos from Sourcegraph as follows:

1. exec into the gitserver pod

2. create the file /etc/gitconfig

3. contents of /etc/gitconfig

  [http]
  sslcainfo = /etc/ssl/certs/rootCA.pem

4. add pem file to /etc/ssl/certs/rootCA.pm

For a permanent fix, the customer is currently using the experimental tls.external flag located in the example site config here.
