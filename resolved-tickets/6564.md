## Summary
### Customer Question
​Hi there! Do you maintain your IDE extensions, or are those community maintained?
​
​It seems like the “copy link to file” doesn’t work with our managed instance. Instead of navigating to tinder.sourcegraph.com it goes to just sourcegraph.com and cannot find our repos.

### Application Engineer Answer
​
I was just in the middle of trying [this] out for you before I suggested them to you. But if you haven’t tried them yet I’m very positive this should fix your issue.
