## Summary
### Customer Question
We have one project per deployable artifact. Would we need to build a map of repository to project id in JSON for hundreds of artifacts in order to get this extension working across our code base?
### Application Engineer Answer
It is possible to map multiple sentry projects to project IDs. We have repository filters in the configuration to do that.An example below:
"sentry.decorations.inline": true,
"sentry.organization": "<your_sentry_organization>",
"sentry.projects": [
    {
        // All repositoryA error patterns link to Project A in Sentry
        "projectId": "<project_a>",
        "filters": [
            {
                "repositories": [
                    "myorg/repositoryA$" // Regexp matching repositories that report to this Sentry project
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        // All repositoryB error patterns link to Project B in Sentry
        "projectId": "<project_b>",
        "filters": [
            {
                "repositories": [
                    "myorg/repositoryB$"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]
