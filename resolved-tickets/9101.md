## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Several users lost access to GitLab repos in sourcegraph.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- confirmed if this is a GitLab repo.

### Resolution
We had a known issue where GitLab made a breaking change that affects our integration with this code host which is resolved in the current version you are in. In other for user perms to sync properly, it is advised to log out of sourcegraph, revoke your gitlab token and log back into sourcegraph again.Doing so for users who havent already should get this resolved.
