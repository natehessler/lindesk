## Summary
### Customer Question
The customer wanted to get a list of contributors in a specific repo but had it nested under an existing GraphQL query here. This didn't yield any results for the list of contributors as the customer expected. 
### Application Engineer Answer
Requested the customer to run this query instead, which was successful.

{
repositories(names: "github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph") {
nodes {
id
name
contributors(after: "last week") {
nodes {
person {
name
email
}
}
}
}
}
}
