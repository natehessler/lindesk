## Summary

### Customer Question

In https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/28987issue#28987> it shows the Subscription link, however, on the site admin (local build) there's no instance of that component whatsoever.

Do I need extra configuration to show the Subscription component?


### Application Engineer Answer

Could try running this instead:
SOURCEGRAPH_API_URL=https://sourcegraph.com sg start web-standalone
