## Summary
### Customer Question
I wonder if there is a way to configure SourceGraph so that it recognizes .jsonnet.TEMPLATE file and render it as .jsonnet? 

### Application Engineer Answer
It is possible to configure (in the site config) what language a file should be highlighted as, based on the file extension pattern.

```
"syntaxHighlighting": {
  "engine": {
    "default": "syntect"
  },
  "languages": {
    "extensions": {},
    "patterns": [
      {
        "language": "jsonnet",
        "pattern": "jsonnet.template"
      },
    ]
  }
}
```
