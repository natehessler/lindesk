## Summary
### Customer Question
I’d like some help in getting the new vscode client configured correctly. I’ll post my current setup and results in a thread in a moment.

### Application Engineer Answer
this issue was revealed to have to do mostly with the Sourcegraph extension needing to make requests to a specific URI on Twitters git server

sourcegraph.remoteUrlReplacements was required for the extension to redirect properly

```
"sourcegraph.accessToken": "",
    "sourcegraph.url": "https://sourcegraph.twitter.biz (https://sourcegraph.twitter.biz/)",
    "sourcegraph.defaultBranch": "master",
    "sourcegraph.remoteUrlReplacements": {"https://git.twitter.biz/": "https://git.twitter.biz/ro/"},
```
