## Summary
### Customer Question
Looks like I was able to resolve these and checkout to 3.28 branch but I got the following:  
git merge $SOURCEGRAPH_VERSION  
Already up-to-date  
Then, I ran all the docker commands specified in your docs and got the following output:  
However, sourcegraph is still down on your instance. Please advise on what steps I should take to bring it back up.

### Application Engineer Answer
The instance came back up after running curl -vv localhost, and doing docker compose down and up, and then changing the image files in docker-compose.yaml.  
I have some commands that can help us determine if the Sourcegraph server is accessible after the upgrade and there's something else blocking access to Sourcegraph.
```
curl -vv localhost
docker-compose logs caddy
docker-compose logs sourcegraph-frontend-0
docker ps --format {{.Image}}
docker ps
```
