## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue:  

Customer unable to browse non-main branches on a monorepo

### Troubleshooting Steps:

- requested logs from gitserver and repo-updater: found some long executing requests
- requested Grafana dashboards for repo-updater: found performance issues, including long running requests
- Asked admin if they had provisioned resources according to our Monorepo scaling docs: https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/kubernetes/scale#improving-performance-with-large-monorepos
- They had not, so they performed the necessary re-provisioning and the problem is now resolved

### Resolution:

Reprovisioning their k8s with better resource limits fixed the issue  

### Relevant Error / Logs:

`Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0`
