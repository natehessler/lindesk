## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer need help with an issue with SourceGraph CLI `src`
The regex using to search -
```
r:gateway-master file:gateway_server/ikat_control_plane/latest_build_num.sh select:content .* count:all patternType:regexp
```

The above regex gives the required output from web UI but not from `src` cli on Linux
```
$ src search -stream 'r:gateway-master file:gateway_server/ikat_control_plane/latest_build_num.sh select:content .* count:all patternType:regexp'
gateway-master › gateway_server/ikat_control_plane/latest_build_num.sh (0 matches)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✱ 7 results in 9ms from 1 Repositories

```

### Troubleshooting Steps
I have been able to replicate a similar behavior on my end.
- First query returns 0 matches but 1 results in 1 repo
- The second query with the addition of `-json` parameter returns a match.
### Resolution
It worked for the customer after replacing `stream` with `json`
