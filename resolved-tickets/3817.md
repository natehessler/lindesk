## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue:  
A new user is having problems login into Sourcegraph.


### Troubleshooting Steps:  
Asked the site admin to check to see if this particular user/ email has an account already created. If yes, is this user using the right login credentials (email/password)?
Also, checked if  allowSignup: false in the existing auth config?
Get the Browser (network) trace while the user is trying to log in.
Enable oAuth log traces - Set the env var INSECURE_OAUTH2_LOG_TRACES=1 to log all OAuth2 requests and responses on Docker Compose and Kubernetes: the sourcegraph-frontend deployment. if it's a single container - set the env variable the sourcegraph/server container.


### Resolution: 
It was later discovered that the Customer has gotten to their license cap and this is why new users can't signup. We increased the limits on our end and the users were able to sign up successfully.


### Relevant Error / Logs:  

<!-- Please redact keys, tokens, and personal identifying information -->

```No user exists matching any of the verified emails: xxxxxx@gmail.com, xxxx@xxxxx.xxl.

First error was: User account with verified email "xxxxxxxx@gmail.com" does not exist. Ask a site admin to create your account and then verify your email.```
