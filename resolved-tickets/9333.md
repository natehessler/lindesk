## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer wanted to know if there are ways to track API calls across their code base. Examples of what they're looking for:
```
"Cresta SPA (browser)
User sends "Create" request for todo
API-router
Receives create todo request and sends to backend service
Todo service
Handles todo request
Returns new todo to Cresta SPA
Cresta SPA (browser)
Receives new todo object
Puts it into the todo list
```
```
So the structure is like this:
proto repo: Has the original proto files and generated libraries
client repo: Typescript web app that installs the generated TS client library from private npm
server repo: Go servers that depends on the generated Go libraries.

One possible way of tracking it is:
From the client repo
-> cross reference to the invocation of a method in client library
-> cross reference to the proto that defines the method
-> cross reference to the generated server library
-> cross reference to the server implementation code
```

### Application Engineer Answer
The closest thing that we have is probably our code intelligence features. anything more specific will likely be a feature request
