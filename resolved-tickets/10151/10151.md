## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer experiences a several second delay when opening links in vs code
### Application Engineer Answer
from the customer's video, they are opening a local file so this rules out issues of network connection. <br /> recommended they try updating vs code to see if they still have a lag
<br />had to close ticket due to no response so not clear if this resolved the problem or if it went away for another reason
