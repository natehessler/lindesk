## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue:  The precise-code-intel-worker was not starting up and the health check never returns a response.

### Troubleshooting Steps:  
1. The customer retrieved a log from the precise-code-intel-worker that stated an error when trying to create a storage bucket.
2. The customer was directed to change the precise-code-intel-worker environment variables relevant to the storage bucket.
3. The following environment variables were changed: 
PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_ENDPOINT 
PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your access key>
PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your secret key>

### Resolution:  The environment variable changes successfully resolved the storage bucket error and allowed the precise-code-intel-worker  to start successfully.

### Relevant Error / Logs:  
{"log":"2021/10/20 19:56:54 Failed to initialize upload store: failed to create bucket: retry quota exceeded, 0 available, 5 requested\n","stream":"stderr","time":"2021-10-20T19:56:54.862255549Z"}
