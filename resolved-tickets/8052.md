## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer accidentally added public repos into their instance and deleted the code host connection. The repos that were queued for cloning were not disappearing from the UI and the customer was uncomfortable about that
### Troubleshooting Steps
Confirm the number of repos by running in GQL:
{
  "data": {
    "repositories": {
      "totalCount": 85747
    }
  }
}

query {
  externalServices {
    nodes {
      kind,
      repoCount
    }
  }
}


### Resolution
Asked the customer to Exec into your Postgres pod by running kubectl exec -it <$pgsql_pod> -- psql -U sg
Confirm if we do have soft deleted repos by running this SQL query; SELECT id, name FROM repo WHERE name LIKE 'DELETED%';
If you get results then we can proceed to remove them by running; DELETE FROM repo WHERE name LIKE 'DELETED%';
Once this is done, please feel free to restart your deployment and check on repos to see if the Not cloned repos still are visible.


The customer didn't find the DELETED key words but used the isPrivate: False filter to remove the repos from their org.
