## Summary
### Customer Question

:wave::skin-tone-4:, Looking at this doc: https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/external_services/postgres#general-recommendations, do i have to name my dbnames and users these values

docker run [...] -e PGHOST=psql1.mycompany.org -e PGUSER=sourcegraph -e PGPASSWORD=secret -e PGDATABASE=sourcegraph -e PGSSLMODE=require -e CODEINTEL_PGHOST=psql2.mycompany.org -e CODEINTEL_PGUSER=sourcegraph -e CODEINTEL_PGPASSWORD=secret -e CODEINTEL_PGDATABASE=sourcegraph-codeintel -e CODEINTEL_PGSSLMODE=require sourcegraph/server:3.36.3

when using AWS cloudformation?
I just tried to create a db with the name sourcegraph-codeintel
and i run into

DatabaseName must begin with a letter and contain only alphanumeric characters. …


### Application Engineer Answer

After a little investigation it does look like this is a hardcoded value in our server deployment -- happy to flag a CE in to make a feature request on this since it seems like this isn't going to work with AWS cloudformation with the current code for server

Note in docker-compose and kubernetes deployments this doesn't appear to be hard coded the same way
