## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

The Customer is getting errors when he attempts to run the app.


### Troubleshooting Steps
- This looks like Webpack not resolving an import.

- Asked to check that the ```webpack.config.js``` file is the same as what we have in our code? 

- I noticed there were some changes to that particular [file](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/commit/105cf03e700e6a373a25ad008c4a93165fb98882). 

- If there are no differences, can you check the following one after the other; Can you check that on line 188 of your ```webpack.config.js``` file you have the extension ```.ts``` in the array list. 

- Also, I think this particular [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43037590/field-browser-doesnt-contain-a-valid-alias-configuration) may be helpful. Based on the info I gathered in the above link, on line 193 of your webpack.config.js fil e can you add an ./ in front of node_modules/react-visibility-sensor/visibility-sensor.js' to look like './node_modules/react-visibility-sensor/visibility-sensor.js'

- Try running this command to clear the local package cache.

```
yarn cache clean
rm -rf node_modules
yarn
```


### Resolution

- running ```yarn generate``` and then restarting the server fixed the issue.
