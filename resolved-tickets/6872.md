<!-- Data populated from integration, speak to Ben Gordon or Michael Bali if not working -->
<!-- During Internal team trial, fill missing data manually (we are waiting for all data to sync) -->

## Technical Environment
- Version: ​3.34.2
- Deployment: Nomad (not currently supported at time of writing. Customer is sort of referencing all the deployment installation docs, to put together a picture/approach that makes sense. I believe..... one of these Pandora/Nomad tickets indicate that a Nomad deployment would be best advised by a docker-compose deployment?)
- External Services: Uh GitHub? I think
- Auth Providers: Not known/setup yet

## Summary
### Customer Question
How to check that frontend-internal is healthy/up?

Basically, is there a route/endpoint that we can reach easily, to get an idea if it's working?

### Application Engineer Answer

Not sure, but here are some code files that might be worth mentioning/thinking about:

- Any route [here](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/cmd/frontend/internal/httpapi/router/router.go?L119) would theoretically work, I think?
- Also, seems to suggest that there's a `healthz` endpoint : https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/6afadc4b879392073740c2f4588a73bedfb443c8/internal/httpserver/handler.go
- Maybe a `/heartbeat` here?: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/6afadc4b879392073740c2f4588a73bedfb443c8/enterprise/cmd/executor-queue/internal/server/routes.go#L35
- I think we also checked `ping`: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@6afadc4b879392073740c2f4588a73bedfb443c8/-/blob/internal/api/internal_client.go?L43

The idea is basically: Pick the simplest sounding endpoint, and try to reach it with whatever request-making tool/utility that you want (e.g.  `curl, or like http`). This probably applies to any service, really.
