## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

This issue is about Twitters code intelligence results coming in too slowly on tooltip hovers.
In general, this is the result of possible underprovisioning on the instance, however this issue has gone stale.


### Troubleshooting Steps

Check services grafana charts for provisioning indicators (symbols, zoekt-indexserver, 
gitserver)

### Resolution

Stale Issue, likely performance may be improved by adding more resources to gitserver and symbols

A trace of the graphQL hover request would also be of value in this instance
