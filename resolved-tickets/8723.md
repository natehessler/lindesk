## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer is getting some 'signal: killed' errors when they are running their batch change. It looks like the issue is happening while batch changes try to unzip the repo. 

### Troubleshooting Steps
Checked ggitserver logs for any errors with the repos but we didn't see anything.
Tried adding -workspace volume to the src batch preview command but got a similar result where it only worked for some repos and then stopped and had to be restarted

### Resolution
The user could try running fewer tasks in parallel (at the cost of execution time). You could start with -j 1 (so it literally runs one at a time), and then slowly ramp back up from there.
It would also be worth checking how much RAM the user has allocated to Docker. 

### Relevant Error / Logs
<!-- Please redact keys, tokens, and personal identifying information -->
unzip output: signal killed
