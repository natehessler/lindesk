## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

Steps to reproduce:

Attempted to update some batch changes after they have been published
Most of those changes are now in an error state and failing with errors like:

`Updating changeset: Bitbucket API HTTP error: code=409 url="<url example here>" body="{"errors":[{"context":null,"message":"You are attempting to modify a pull request based on out-of-date information.","exceptionName":"com.atlassian.bitbucket.pull.PullRequestOutOfDateException","currentVersion":2,"expectedVersion":1,"pullRequest":{"id":89,"version":2,...`

Updated step: This looks like it could have been caused by changing the PR title and/or description in the batch change.
Reverting the title/description changes appears to get sourcegraph back in a better state.

Expected behavior:
Batch change should succeed without error or not get stuck in a failed state.

Actual behavior:
Stuck in a failed state.
