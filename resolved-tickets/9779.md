## Summary
### Customer Question
Hi there, how could we allow notebooks on our sourcegraph instance?

### Application Engineer Answer
Hi @jeremy, I researched more and found Notebooks are only available starting version 3.36.0 and Atlassian is currently on version 3.34.2, so unfortunately it can't be enabled on this version. Please refer to this link for more information.
