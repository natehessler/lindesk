## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue

The customer got the below error during upgrade to 3.36
* accumulateDirector error: "recursed accumulation of path '/tmp/kustomize-711928850/repo': accumulating resources: 2 errors occurred:\n\t* accumulateFile error: \"accumulating resources from 'backend.Service.yaml': evalsymlink failure on '/tmp/kustomize-711928850/repo/backend.Service.yaml' : lstat /tmp/kustomize-711928850/repo/backend.Service.yaml: no such file or directory\"\n\t* loader.New error: \"error loading backend.Service.yaml with git: url lacks orgRepo: backend.Service.yaml, dir: evalsymlink failure on '/tmp/kustomize-711928850/repo/backend.Service.yaml' : lstat /tmp/kustomize-711928850/repo/backend.Service.yaml: no such file or directory, get: invalid source string: backend.Service.yaml\"\n\n"

backend.Service.yaml might not exist in the latest upgrade. Could you please look into this at your earliest. This is blocking upgrade.

In addition, the customer reported that after adding previously removed code hosts, there was a spinning icon.
### Troubleshooting Steps
Using our deployment manifest for 3.35>3.36 we took a look at the PR to remove the service entirely because it was unused
### Resolution
Removed the backend service manifest from the kustomize file.

Increased the liveness probe for gitserver to 1200s.
