## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer wanted to know if it's possible to retry failed batch changes automatically.
### Application Engineer Answer
There is some automation in place that will retry batch changes that aren't fully carried out the first time but once a changeset is marked as failed, that could indicate that user intervention is needed so for this reason, it isn't automatically re-enqueued
