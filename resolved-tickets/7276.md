## Summary
### Customer Question
Grafana and prometheus not displaying any data
### Application Engineer Answer
Prometheus logs indicated that this might be a permissions error. At first glance the contents of their `prometheus.ClusterRoleBinding.yaml` file looked okay <-- it was not! `namespace` value was set to `default` but should have been `ns-sourcegraph`
Before this, we thought it was because sourcegraph was having trouble connecting to the kubernetes api so we tried adding `prometheus.ClusterRoleBinding.yaml` from `base` to `overlays/non-privileged/prometheus`
