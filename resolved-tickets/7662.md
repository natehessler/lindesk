## Summary
### Customer Question
> I’ll jump in with a question already sweat_smile I attempted setting up the CLI (`src`) but then I hit this:
```
src login

❌ Problem: Error communicating with https://sourcegraph.open.ch: Post "https://sourcegraph.open.ch/.api/graphql": x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```
> So somewhere I’m hitting the proxy most likely, although I’m not sure I should. Any hints? Any flags i can use to debug? Should I report it directly on github?


### Application Engineer Answer
This is a certificate issue, so there's a limit to what we can offer here. You can use the `-insecure-skip-verify` flag to circumvent the unknown cert authority.
