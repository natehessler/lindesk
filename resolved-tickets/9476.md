## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue

The customer is not able to render charts properly for the search query "@allegro-runtime/opbox-runtime":"19 as a literal search. The charts are reporting zero occurrences even when search query returns results when searching directly through code search.


### Troubleshooting Steps

- Requested details about search over targeted repo or all repo's, what chart settings are used etc.
- Replicated the issue on internal k8 environment and reported to code insight team




### Resolution

The issue seems to be related to a bug in the system where these types of literal searches were not being handled properly at the backend , as a workaround customer is advised to use regex, and a relevant query was provided to address the issue.
