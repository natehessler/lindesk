## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Customer running into following error when creating a batch change:


### Troubleshooting Steps
Consulted with colleagues, webhooks not being enabled was identified as the very likely cause. Confirmed with customer that they were not enabling webhooks.

### Resolution
They cannot use webhooks because it will cause other errors for them. From Ricardo:

"Unfortunately, enabling webhook will result in other errors for us. The webhooks will notify Soucegraph about all repos, including repos our Sourcegraph instance does not have access to."
