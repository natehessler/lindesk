## Summary
### Customer Question
I am creating the infrastructure needed to enable code intel, but when trying to create it using <https://registry.terraform.io/modules/sourcegraph/executors/aws/3.42.0?tab=inputs|the terraform module> it is not able to create de security group (due to some internal policies) is there a way to set the security as an input o link this to an existing security group?
### Application Engineer Answer
you can use an existing security group. You can follow this example but leave out the networking component that is highlighted. In its place you can put your own custom VPC and subnet IDs
