## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
`failed to retrieve credentials` messages in events log of an aws-ebs-csi & k8s deployment.

### Troubleshooting Steps
Customer provided logs/"events of the namespace", which maybe is like... an events log? But yeah, combed through that with my eyeballs, and failed to retrieve credentials really stood out.

### Resolution
I recommended them to re-follow [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-ebs-csi.html) doc that had been shared to them, since it seemed to address authorization.

Customer lated reported success [:
