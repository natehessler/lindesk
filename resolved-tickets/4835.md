## Summary

### Customer Question

When/how is the `extsvc.json` updated?


### Application Engineer Answer
Both on server restart, and on a "watch" loop.
The "watch" loop is encoded [here](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@f2920c028a5bda144ca165557834a7411f51e352/-/blob/cmd/frontend/internal/cli/config.go?L323:6).  And [this](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@f2920c028a5bda144ca165557834a7411f51e352/-/blob/cmd/frontend/internal/cli/config.go?L177) function to override the extsvc file is ran every server restart.
