## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
I can’t get the LSIF upload with the CLI command to work (`src lsif upload`).
I could not find any specific documentation for uploading LSIF data to a repo which belongs to an organization on Sourcegraph Cloud.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- Today, Users can upload LSIF indexes on Cloud today if:
      (1) it’s a repo hosted on github.com or gitlab.com
      (2) you can supply a GitHub access token with `repo `scope of that repository and they have some level of `write `access to that repo on the code host with that token.
- I would like to find out if your access token has the repo scope and if you have  write access to the repository in your code host?



### Resolution

### Relevant Docs Pages Used/Created
using  `src lsif upload -gitlab-token=` cleared the unauthorized error.
