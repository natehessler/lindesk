## Summary
### Customer Question
When creating a batch change, my query matches 190 repos, and the src CLI processes 190 repos, but only 12 changesets are actually created, and I have no idea why.
### Application Engineer Answer
Were you able to retry the src command with -clear-cache earlier? Perhaps you could try again with this and see if it yields anything different?
The other thoughts we had were related to this file or . files having a gitignore rule in those repos. Might this be the case?
