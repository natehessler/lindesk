## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
- The vscode  redirects to the wrong URL in chrome.


### Troubleshooting Steps
- To kick start investigating this, in your sourcegraph extension setting, can you check to see that the `sourcegraph.url` is pointing to the right URL?
-  On the call we noticed that the URL redirects to the wrong URL by adding `/devs` to the URL causing a mismatch.
- Before making any changes, I'm curious to know why in the codehost config, you are making use of the `devs/` in the `repositoryPathPattern`?

### Resolution
The reason for the mismatch is because of the `repositoryPathPattern: "devs/{nameWithOwner}"` configured in your prod instance. When `repositoryPathPattern` is configured, paths from the full long name will redirect to the configured name. Extensions will function with the configured name. `repositoryPathPattern` allows administrators to configure “nice names”. For example, `sourcegraph.example.com/github.com/foo/bar>` can be configured to be `<http://sourcegraph.example.com/gh/foo/bar|sourcegraph.example.com/gh/foo/bar` with `"repositoryPathPattern": "gh/{nameWithOwner}"` .
