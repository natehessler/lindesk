## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer is using the shell module of ansible to run src validate command which doesn't work, it works fine directly on the remote source instance machine.


### Troubleshooting Steps

Went on call with customer to understand the issue and checked configurations to see if everything is intact 

Ran src validation on customer remote instance and it worked fine but not from ansible shell

locally created and ansible script and replicated the issue, also discussed with escalation engineering team.

Ran other src commands and verified the results. 



### Resolution
The src validation command works when run as a script inside ansible but not if run as a command via a builtin shell module. Checked and confirmed that it's not a problem with the src tool as other src commands are running fine from the ansible builtin shell. src validate is mentioned as an experimental command so that seems to be the reason of this discrepancy, customer was fine using the script for now via ansible.
