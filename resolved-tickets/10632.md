## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
"hi sourcegraph folks! im using the batch changes tool to manage about 20 changesets… but im having some UI issues :disappointed: when i click “show more” to view additional changesets, the page gets into a reload loop making it impossible to scroll down to the bottom. im using the latest chrome, which displays this message in the browser console:"

```
createBrowserHistory.js:217 Throttling navigation to prevent the browser from hanging. See https://crbug.com/1038223. Command line switch --disable-ipc-flooding-protection can be used to bypass the protection
```

When attempting in safari, they got the following error message: 
```
Sourcegraph encountered an unexpected error. If reloading the page doesn't fix it, contact your site admin or Sourcegraph support.

Attempt to use history.replaceState() more than 100 times per 30 seconds
```

### Troubleshooting Steps
As this was pretty clearly a bug, I opened an issue with batch changes immediately, who then began immediately working on patch 3.43.1 to fix the issue. 
 
### Resolution
[This patch](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/40862) will fix the issue.
