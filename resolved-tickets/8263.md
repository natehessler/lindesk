## Summary
### Customer Question
Is there a way to download all the contents of a repository from Sourcegraph?
### Application Engineer Answer
The customer explained that they'd want to be able to use Sourcegraph as a place to get code in an emergency if our code host isn't available.

This is now a FR.
