### Application Engineer Answer
​
​A call with the customer CE Nate Maynard, AppE Amber Furbush and myself was had. The customer was told that the GitHub sign-in flow that they were experiencing was working as intended.

They were given instruction on how to create a GitHub App under an organization rather than an individual user in order to get around their SSO being dependent on one user having access.
