## Summary
### Customer Question
I'm trying to find all usages of `Document.Error` field, including implicit ones 

### Application Engineer Answer

Since all the usage of `Document.Error` may not follow a particular structure we might not necessarily need to use structural search. An alternative to LSIF you can try is searching with the query, `Document.Error or doc.Error` which can help find all usages of `Document.Error` including implicit ones.
