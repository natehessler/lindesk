## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Unrecognized patterType: 0xc0049a4910 

This happens when going from a code insights to a search query. Looks like a simple issue with the deeplink – explicitly clicking on the regex mode fixes it.

### Troubleshooting Steps
This is an irregular parsing of a query in code insights that doesn't have a proper patternType syntax passed.
### Resolution
I'd just like to callout something for you if I may, the issue in the first screenshot was because the patternType in the insight query was patterntype:regex .This should be patternType: regexp (regex with a p at the end :sweat_smile:. Oh the subtleties) .
Of course you can avoid inputting this patternType manually since we have a logic in the creation UI that adds the correct patternType automatically for the capture group insight which explains why in my reprod, I was able to automatically get a regexp query when I clicked on the insight.
Also just as a side note, our search team folks are exploring adding an alias for regex to help avoid this error in the future.
