## Summary
### Customer Question
I’m trying to get this insights https://sourcegraph.infra.stag.thriveglobal.com/insights/insight/aW5zaWdodF92aWV3OiIyOXZyM3BuM296Wm9HaEdtNGdSRVhYTmFsQVMigraph> to show correctly. Not sure if I’m doing something wrong or not.
Could you have a look please?

I want to
search for graphRef: Federated-Gateway-Production-arkg55@current
in files called argo/platform-config.yaml
and plot the number over time.
Thanks
### Application Engineer Answer
Got it! Thanks.
This should look like.

file:argo/platform-config.yaml content:graphRef:\bFederated-Gateway-Production-arkg55@current

I believe you'd want to run this across all repositories. Just a quick caveat that this may take some time to return a plot.
