## Summary

### Customer Question

Is there a way to bypass Windows file path character limit of 260, when using src ?

### Application Engineer Answer

Unfortunately, no. It seems to be a Windows issue that Sourcegraph wouldn't have control over. Shared possible helpful links to the user, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22575662/filename-too-long-in-git-for-windows) and [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/266621/how-to-make-windows-10-accept-file-paths-over-260-characters/) .
