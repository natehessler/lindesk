Error starting SAML-authenticated session. Try signing in again.

### Application Engineer Answer

Hey @mert glad to hear this went back to normal -- typically when we've seen problems with this its had to do with misconfigurations around the callback between the identity provider and the Sourcegraph instance. Seems like this was likely caused by an ephemeral error with the network.I'll keep an eye on this thread, @rene might be worth taking a look at frontend logs for any network connection blips or logs from the saml exchange
