## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

Batch changes were stuck in a "processing" state on the UI page.



### Troubleshooting Steps

The steps that I had conducted didn't surface too much useful information, unfortunately. But there was a lot of chatter regarding batch changes within the channel at the time, so we had deferred to getting it setup first before pursuing troubleshooting here.



### Resolution

Having the customer set up webhooks was the final recommendation. Since then, no more escalations in this thread.
