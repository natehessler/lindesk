## Summary
### Customer Question
After performing a multi-version upgrade on their prod from 3.34.1 to 4.1.2, we noticed that their private GitHub repos aren't indexing but cloned.

### Application Engineer Answer
In the indexed-search instrumentation page, there is no Debug page linked; just the Traces link. Based on browsing the git blame for that link, it appears that 3.34.1 would not have it. This leads us to suspect that perhaps the zoekt instances were not upgraded to 4.1.2.
