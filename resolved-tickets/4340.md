## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue
The customer reported that after enabling the Open in VSCode extension, the button only opened multiple blank windows.



### Troubleshooting Steps
Checked that the path was configured correctly in the settings. 
```
{
  "extensions": {
    "sourcegraph/open-in-vscode": true,
    "sourcegraph/github-extras": true
  },
  "vscode.open.basePath": "/home/user/",
  "vscode.open.useMode": "ssh",
  "vscode.open.remoteHost": "user@host",
}
```
Checked that the file path was not working vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+user@host/home/user/file.txt
Confirmed that they could open the file and that the file was available on the host.



### Resolution
The extension only builds the path to the file so we thought there was something happening on the VSCode end.
We found this bug on VSCode that opens multiple blank windows when opening from a remote host.
There is a workaround in the issue and this seems to work for the customer.
