## Summary
### Customer Question
Is this what is breaking the clones?  
`"fatal: commit-graph requires overflow generation data but has none\n": exit status 128`

### Application Engineer Answer
We identified a bug in our 3.42 release that can cause issues with gitserver and are patching it now. If you are experiencing significant issues, there is currently a workaround to disable Sourcegraph maintenance by setting this environment variable on gitserver: SRC_ENABLE_SG_MAINTENANCE=false
