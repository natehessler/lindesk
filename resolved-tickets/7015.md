## Summary
### Customer Question
The customer was not seeing the private repositories from their organization.  
​
### Application Engineer Answer
The customer was guided to update their code host connection to their organization in Sourcegraph with the following instructions:
​

Make sure that the customer has an update to date PAT under the organization’s code host connection (Click on the organization the user belongs to > Settings > Code Host Connections > Update)
​
Should the user be using an SAML SSO to log into GitHub then that PAT will have to be authorized after it is generated as demonstrated here.
