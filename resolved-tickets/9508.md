## Summary
### Customer Question
A customer was locked out of their managed instance during setup -- the database (under the USERS table) showed that the instance had the registered user (created by our admins).

### Application Engineer Answer

On further investigation, the frontend logs revealed that the admin had been trying to log in via the wrong username after receiving the password reset link and attempting to update the password
