## Summary
### Customer Question
If SourceGraph will be removing extension in September what will be replacing it?
### Application Engineer Answer
Earlier versions of Sourcegraph should be able to continue using their current extensions for the time being. Once you update to 4.0, you can then enable extensions again with a feature flag. We’ll have more updates on this in our docs as we announce more details on 4.0 but in short all you’d likely need to do is add enableLegacyExtensions: true to your site config
