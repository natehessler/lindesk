## Summary
### Customer Question
Trying to install the phabricator extension for sourcegraph, but seeing this in the logs
Access to fetch at 'https://sourcegraph-staging.twitter.biz/.assets/extension/css/style.bundle.css?v=0.0.0' from origin 'https://phabricator-staging.twitter.biz' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

"corsOrigin": "https://phabricator-staging.twitter.biz"


### Application Engineer Answer
the admin was able to figure this one out independently
this is almost certainly an internal security restriction with our frontend routers. working through it now.
