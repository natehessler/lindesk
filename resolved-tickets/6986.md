## Summary
### Customer Question
I just attempted to preview a batch change with our sourcegraph instance and ran in to some errors when viewing my preview:  
ERROR: permission denied for view tracking_changeset_specs_and_changesets (SQLSTATE 42501)

### Application Engineer Answer
The admin had changed the view permissions for users. They were able to change them and the user was able to see the batch change preview.
