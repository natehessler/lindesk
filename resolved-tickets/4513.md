## Summary

### Customer Question

Quick question - are we able to deploy sourcegraph as a non-root user? This is mandatory for Tess deployments now.


### CSE Answer

"I’ve got an answer for you :simple_smile:.  You would use overlays, specifically a non-privileged overlay to achieve this https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/kubernetes/configure#non-privileged-overlay "
