## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer received this error message when performing an upgrade from 3.36 to 3.37.
FATA[0000] failure: {"status":"failure","reason":"failed to process signing request: failed to process artifact cimage:registry.aws.site.gs.com:443/dx/code-search-tools/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/migrator:release-3.37.0: failed to obtain manifest for image [registry.aws.site.gs.com:443/dx/code-search-tools/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/migrator:release-3.37.0]: failed to perform bearer auth query with registry https://registry.aws.site.gs.com:443/v2/dx/code-search-tools/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/migrator/manifests/release-3.37.0; status code is 404"}


Also, their remote published extensions weren't showing up after publishing.
### Troubleshooting Steps
The error is related to the migrator service which was introduce in 3.37.
### Resolution
We updated the frontend yaml with this: https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph/blob/v3.37.0/configure/migrator/migrator.Job.yaml#L20-L61 and added relevant configurations for PGHOST, PGPASSWORD etc.

On offline extensions, the problem was just the license key wasn't applied on dev.
