## Summary
### Customer Question
Is there a way to configure the Sourcegraph Intellij plugin to search in our custom sourcegraph domain instead of sourcegraph.com? 

### Application Engineer Answer
It is possible to configure the IntelliJ plugin for use with a private Sourcegraph instance. You can refer to the documentation here for these details.
