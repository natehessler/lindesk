## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue

We now have the chrome browser extension working however I have tried to integrate the extension into phabricator itself via https://github.com/sourcegraph/phabricator-extension and we are getting the following issue https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/42555

### Troubleshooting Steps

- The error seems to be related to the configuration of the `corsOrigin` in your sourcegraph instance?

- Do you have your site config updated with the `corsOrigin` pointing to your PHABRICATOR URL?

- In phabricator is the `sourcegraph.url` configuration value set to your Sourcegraph URL?

- There was a similar issue reported by another customer a while ago. Looks like the problem was in their internal network security settings. Is it possible to look at any security/ network changes internally that may have caused this?

- 

### Resolution
We have been able to find the root cause of the issue. This is related to the `frontend` service that doesn't allow cross-origin static asset requests. [This change was introduced a year ago](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/27246). A fix has been merged and the patch will be available for the next scheduled release
