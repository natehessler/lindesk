## Summary
### Customer Question
Have you tested the sourcegraph docker compose setup with docker compose v2? If so, which versions of sourcegraph are compatible with it?

### Application Engineer Answer
We haven’t seen any issues with Docker Compose v2.5. We do use  service_completed_successfully which was introduced in Docker Compose v1.29 so that would be the minimum version required.
