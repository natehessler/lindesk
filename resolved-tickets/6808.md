## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue

Customer reports slow search times among other problems

### Troubleshooting Steps

observed container provisioning for the gitserver and other services -- this lead to an investigation of logs.

TL;DR the sg_maintenance routine had begun to fail and the admin reported that their monorepo had stacked up an unusual amount of git pack files

### Resolution

The monorepo was removed and recloned to clean the git rev tree

There were other issues conflated here as well, but the admin elected to no longer pursue investigation -- 

Other instances of sg_maintenance were observed in other production  being a result environments. This likely due to the inclusion of an experimental geometric git pack command in the sg_maintenance routine.
