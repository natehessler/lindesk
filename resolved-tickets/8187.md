## Summary
### Customer Question
is it possible to generate individual series off of a capture group in the `file:...` filter? I'm seeing all of the results I would expect from creating an insight from this query, but it only creates a single series: <br />
`file:^services\/(\w*)\/.*$ from @helloextend\/.*\/types patterntype:regexp` <br />
I found this section of the docs but it looks like the capture group might be expected in the source re pattern https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_insights/explanations/automatically_generated_data_series#automatic-generation-of-individual-series
what I'm expecting is one series per child subdirectory, ie `services/child/...` => `child`
### Application Engineer Answer
I’m just seeing now that for the `file:` filter, automatically generated individual series is not currently supported, regardless of version number. Can you tell me a little more about why you are interested in this/what you’re hoping to do with this? We can file a feature request and/or see if there’s a workaround for what you’re trying to do. <br /> editing to add: This is where we have some of the current limitations of this feature
https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_insights/explanations/automatically_generated_data_series#no-capture-groups-in-filter-strings
A capture group in a filter, like repo or file , is currently unsupported
