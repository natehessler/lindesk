## Summary
### Customer Question
(Mostly a feature request, was asking about UX of the extensions):

> is it possible to make the “go to definitions” button stay on github instead of going to sourcegraph? i find it a pretty jarring experience

> Chrome v98.0.4758.80. The extension’s version is 22.2.11.1553

As far as I can tell, there is no bug, and this is mostly a UX request.

### Application Engineer Answer
I let Phil know we'd file a feature request. I also recorded some of my own observations and shared them, just in case:


|Same File ? | Same Repo ? | Same Org ? | From GitHub Click on "Go to Definition" > Outcome |
|------------|-------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|Yes| Yes| Yes | Stays on tab and stays within GitHub (Example: getInstance ) |
|No| Yes| Yes| Stays on tab and stays within GitHub (Example: HystrixConcurrencyStrategy |
|No|No|Yes|No observation recorded |
|No| No| No| New tab goes to Sourcegraph (Example: caches.get() ) |


|Same File ? | Same Repo ? | Same Org ? | From GitHub  Click on token > Outcome |
|------------|-------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|Yes| Yes| Yes | Stays on tab and stays within GitHub (Example: getInstance ) |
|No| Yes| Yes| Stays on tab and stays within GitHub (Example: HystrixConcurrencyStrategy) |
|No|No|Yes|No observation recorded |
|No| No| No| None| click on token does not navigate anywhere (Example: caches.get() ) |
