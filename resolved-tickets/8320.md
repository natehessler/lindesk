## Summary
### Customer Question
It looks like structural queries count each line in a multi-line result towards the results total.
For example, in this query (from official docs):
https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+fm[…]dkF5krozJjSJxqysmCbGxyvkZ9U0HQ9K7FRGhUeCXJZpWGJgaAi5tEALw_wcB
you can see the highlighted lines in session.go count as 10 matches, even thought it's really one one "instance" of the query being matched.
<br /> Is there some way around this? Either by changing the query or by changing some setting.
For my particular use case, I'd like to know how often something is imported, where imports sometimes take up multiple lines <br />
So results like
`import { Button } from 'modules/ui'` 
add +1 to the result count,
but
```
import {
  Button,
  Icon,
  Text,
} from 'modules/ui'
```
would add +5 to the results total. <br />
Alternatively, if there is a way to display total number of files that include a match for my query instead of total instances, that would solve my particular problem.

### Application Engineer Answer
To get the number of results to reflect just the number of files that include a match you can add `select:file` to your query.
This hides the highlighted results so this is not a perfect solution --> filed a feature request
