## Summary
### Customer Question
Hey, I got a seemingly odd response from the graphql endpoint. approximateResultsCount under results differs from the value under stats.

### Application Engineer Answer
The stats API is an experimental feature that is being phased out. It's only used by some Code Insights things but will be replaced in the future.
