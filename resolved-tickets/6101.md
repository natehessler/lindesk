## Summary
### Customer Question

I would like a query that works across repos and looks for recent changes to a  particular file that has the same name across repos. Is there a way to do this in Sourcegraph,

### Application Engineer Answer

After doing a little investigation I think the best query to accomplish this is going to be a query that uses the type:diff or type:commit functionality (docs here)I did a little test run on my instance. This was a bit noisy but I believe its in the ballpark of functionality you're looking for --
type:commit after:today file:(.*)(sourcegraph-frontend\.deployment\.yaml)$
