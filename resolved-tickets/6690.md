## Summary
### Customer Question
I'm setting up an external Redis host(s) for Sourcegraph on AWS ElastiCache, I don't see any cluster sizing guidance in your docs. Any recommendations?

### Application Engineer Answer
We don’t have recommendations for ElastiCache, but this is a relatively small service so the defaults in the deploy-sourcegraph repo should be enough for redis-store.
