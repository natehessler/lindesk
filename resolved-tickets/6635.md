### Customer Question
A question. Let’s say I mess up some Batch changes. All the MRs are already created. How to revert this? If I delete the batch change, the MRs and branches on GitLab are not deleted and I have to rename the branch for the fixed Batch change. And by doing this I create a lot of stalled branches. Is there a better option?

### Application Engineer Answer
Batch Changes is designed to be "declarative". So if you mess up something, change the spec, re-apply, and all the changesets will be updated.
If you change the on.repositoriesMacthingQuery, and some repositories are not in target anymore, the changesets will be closed indeed
