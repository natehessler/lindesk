## Summary
### Customer Question
Batch changes are useful but publishing changes is extreamly flakey since we run into github rate limits each time we use the feature. We're able to publish 10-20 batch changes before running into issues and have to delay further publishing by roughly 24h (dont know exactly the downtime so 24h is the practical cycle-time between retires). Since we're often making changes across 100s of repos at a time, what can we do to avoid this issue?

### Application Engineer Answer

Thanks for sharing this, exactly what I am looking for.
You can configure batch changes rollout windows to help schedule changesets.
It's super easy to configure as an admin and we can set that up pretty fast.
Configuring rollout windows allows changesets to be created and updated at a slower or faster rate based on the time of day and/or the day of the week. These windows are applied to changesets across all code hosts.
Sharing a [doc](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/config/batch_changes#batch-changes-site-admin-configuration-reference) on how we can do that.
