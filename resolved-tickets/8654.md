## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue

Customer encountered errors during the upgrade process, with the frontend not initializing correctly despite migrator running and other compose services coming up alright

[ec2-user@ip-10-102-110-121 docker-compose]$ docker-compose up -d

### Troubleshooting Steps

Checked the versions table in the pgsql database
sg=# select * from versions; 
 service  | version |          updated_at           | first_version 
----------+---------+-------------------------------+---------------
 frontend | 3.38.1  | 2022-06-01 01:46:25.983285+00 | 3.29.0


Attempted to manually change the database version using migrator commands -- this didn't work. So despite most of the services being up in v3.40.1 the database was thinking it was still in an older version

Elected to run through upgrades as though the database was in v3.38. So -> v3.39 -> v3.40.1

This worked out and got the database up to v3.40.1
