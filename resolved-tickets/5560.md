### Customer Question
Hi,
I've started the upgrade in prod environment and I have a Issue.
The frontend do not start and I have the bellow error:

t=2022-01-13T15:25:40+0000 lvl=info msg="Checked current version" schema=frontend version=1528395954 dirty=true
ERROR: failed to connect to frontend database: dirty database: schema is marked as dirty but no migrator instance appears to be running
The target schema is marked as dirty and no other migration operation is seen running on this schema. The last migration operation over this schema has failed (or, at least, the migrator instance issuing that m
igration has died). Please contact support@sourcegraph.com for further assistance."
