## Summary
### Customer Question
In the UI, I would see a box with a history of my previous searches, which was useful as I could click one it would redo that search.
This ‘history’ box is no longer around.
Is it possible to get it back?

### Application Engineer Answer

In the site admin panel, do you have any `experimentalFeatures` configured?
If yes, set `"showEnterpriseHomePanels": true` Otherwise, you can do something like the below:

```
"experimentalFeatures": {
    "showEnterpriseHomePanels": false
  }
 ```
