## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer wanted to search for all repos that have a specific library but got zero results using the `repo:deps` keyword. This is in beta at the time of this ticket so they wanted to know if it's available to all users. 
### Application Engineer Answer
From what I could find about beta features, they should be available to all and only features labeled "experimental" would need to be manually enabled. <br />
Based on my understanding of the `deps` keyword, it will return a list of all dependencies in a specified repo. Their first search didn't specify a repo, which is probably why they got no results: `repo:deps(.*node-ipc.*)` While I was researching, the customer found the results they were looking for with `file:contains()`
