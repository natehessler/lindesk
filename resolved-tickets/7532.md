## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer was trying to set up a local development environment using `sg setup` but was running into issues getting some of the dependencies installed and useable. 

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. Followed the quickstart instructions for setting up the local environment [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/setup/quickstart) to attempt to recreate the issue
2. Restart the shell when prompted by `sg`
3. Run `sg doctor` to verify everything is ready
4. Run `sg start oss` to imitate the customer's experience as an open source contributor


### Resolution
Running `sg start oss` after restarting the shell and checking `sg doctor` surfaced an error that the customer was able to trace back to a dirty database error. They reset the `psql` database and got everything working as expected.
