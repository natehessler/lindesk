## Summary
### Customer Question
Does anyone know what might cause some results from a search to not be included in the csv export from the search-export plugin? I am seeing maybe 60% of what is in the portal's search result exported into the CSV

### Application Engineer Answer
The UI uses the streaming API, while the extension uses the GraphQL API. Can you try adding count:all to your query?
