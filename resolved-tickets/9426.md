## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Two repos were stuck in the “Not Cloned” state and not getting synched even after explicitly clicking refresh from the frontend.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1) I first checked the repo mirroring page to confirm current state of repo’s and then looked at the repo-updater logs for any evident errors or issues reported for the two repos not being cloned
2) We couldn’t find any recent logs relevant to the issue in repo-updater logs, nothing noticeable on Grafana dashboard as well.
3) As a next step I looked at the git-server logs for the recent refresh we did on the repo’s and could see “slow http requests” warning messages which could be due to a resource crunch on git-server
4) I suggested customer to use our resource estimator and scale the resources accordingly. Once the git-server resources were scaled up as per the recommendation from the resource estimator,
repo’s started cloning fine and the issue was fixed.

### Resolution
Tuned the resources on git-server as per the resource estimator to remove the pressure on the repo cloning process.
