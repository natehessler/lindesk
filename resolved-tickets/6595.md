## Summary
### Customer Question

Customer asking about resource allocation to Minio, and is trying to deploy Sourcegraph using Nomad.

### Application Engineer Answer
Pointed customer to [resource estimator](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/resource_estimator), and they seemed appreciative. But also mentioned that the support team cannot/does not know how to support them with Nomad. 

Was important to get clarity/be on the same page with rest of team internally for this communication. Specifically, getting on the same page of the conversation, [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/732)
