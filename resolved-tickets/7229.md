## Summary
### Customer Question
> any tips for finding deleted files through sourcegraph? as in, if we know the path of the file, can sourcegraph tell us the last rev that it existed in?


### Application Engineer Answer
> That's absolutely something you can do, taking advantage of [commit diff search](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/explanations/features#commit-diff-search). Combining `type:diff` with `file:path/to.file` in your search query will get you the entire history of that file, including the commit at which it was deleted!
