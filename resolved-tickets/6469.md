## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Customer reports seeing "Private Repository ðŸ”’ " when running searches after running an upgrade
### Troubleshooting Steps
Appears to be expected behavior
Confirmed expected behavior with the customer
### Resolution
The customer's query did not target specific content in the search result, so there was no search result snippet.  This lead to each search result only displaying repository name + "Private Repository", which appears to suggest that the repositories are not available for viewing to the user.  This is not the case, the repos were accessible to the searcher.  The customer modified their query to target specific content in the repos, which populates the search result snippets, and indicated to the user that the repos were accessible.
