## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
- Failed fetch/clone in the UI shows HTTP status 500 error
- Internal repos not getting synced.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- During the screen share, we saw a number of repos that were not non-existent in the external service but present in the DB.
- For the internal repo issue, there were 20 'internal' repos that sourcegraph wasn't seeing. We were able to narrow this down to caching problem on the Github side.

### Resolution
- A soft delete was performed to clear this repos and this got rid of the error in the UI.

- We temporarily changed the repo visibility from 'internal' to 'private' and back to internal to force a resync on GitHub side and we were able to search for the repos both in the Github UI and Sourcegraph.
