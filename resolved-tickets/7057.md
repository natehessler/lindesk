## Summary
### Customer Question

How do I scale sourcegraph and up the resources in the docker compose file?

### Application Engineer Answer

For how to set the frontends, in the docker-compose.yaml there's a note by the sourcegraph-frontend-0 stating that you'd want to apply changes there to the frontend-internal service as well.
 ```
  # Note: SRC_GIT_SERVERS, SEARCHER_URL, and SYMBOLS_URL are space-separated
  # lists which each allow you to specify more container instances for scaling
  # purposes. Be sure to also apply such a change here to the frontend-internal
  # service.
  sourcegraph-frontend-0:
    container_name: sourcegraph-frontend-0
    image: 'index.docker.io/sourcegraph/frontend:3.37.0@sha256:724ccb31e95237cbe12b51f3c8b8d22a7d0ac65a73ee8084614360c2018ce3ca'

The resources you allocate depend on several factors that are deployment specific. I suggest referencing our resource estimator guide here . It's not perfect but it can give you a general idea of how much resources and where.

Also, a good place to check are the Grafana pages for specific services to see if they are showing high memory / cpu usage. For repo updating, those would be services like repo updater, frontend, and gitserver.
