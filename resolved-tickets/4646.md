## Summary

### Customer Question

> How can I view redacted content from codehost config json?


### Application Engineer Answer

You can query the database directly for the configurations

```sql
warrengifford@Warrens-MacBook-Pro ~ % kubectl -n ns-sourcegraph exec -it pgsql-84c986dbc8-55w7x -- psql -U sg
Defaulted container "pgsql" out of: pgsql, pgsql-exporter, correct-data-dir-permissions (init)
psql (12.6)
Type "help" for help.

sg=# select * from external_services
sg-# ;
```
