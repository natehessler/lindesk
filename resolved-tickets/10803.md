## Summary
### Customer Question
​
***The customer was asking for deployment validation, and I collaborated with CE Nate Maynard to dig deeper on what the customer meant in regards to that; below are the clarifying questions**** 
​
Do you have an external database for your Sourcegraph deployment, or are you using the database included with the Sourcegraph Docker Compose deployment?

Can you give me specifics as to what information you’re looking for in regards to:
• Autoscaling for AWS
• TLS config
​
///////CUSTOMER'S CLARIFICATIONS///////
​
Hi Alex, we are using the included database (no external).TLS config -- we are terminating TLS at the the load balancer (aws elb). Wanted to check if it's one of the expected setups.Autoscaling -- currently not turned on I believe. And I wanted to check if there's an official guide on that

### Application Engineer Answer
​
​I see my colleague has already shared database migration documentation with you here :simple_smile:TLS config — The termination of the TLS at an AWS ELB is a setup that customers have used with success in the past we do not currently have a list of prescriptive network setups for Sourcegraph at the moment.Autoscaling - We have official documentation on configuring autoscaling for Sourcegraph executors. Executors can be used for resource-intensive or untrusted code (server-side operations).
