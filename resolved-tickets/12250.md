## Summary
### Customer Question
Hey! I am trying to find Java repos with thousands of lines of code in them, or at least, sorted by lines of code. Is this possible?
​
### Application Engineer Answer
After poking around, it would seem that there is, unfortunately, not way to do this Sourcegraph currently. :sad-cowboy:Our Code Insights team is aware of this feature request, but it is not on our roadmap currently.
