## Summary
### Customer Question
I am looking into migrating minio to s3, Can we use a specific path in the bucket, or does it has to be in the root directory? if a specific path is allowed, can we have a full path in `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_BUCKET=<my bucket name>/<folder_name>`?

### Application Engineer Answer
it's not possible to use a specific path in the bucket, we expect that it would be the entire bucket itself (at the root).
