## Summary
### Customer Question
â€‹
hi all, about a month ago I could still search all my public and private repo in SourceGraph (linked to SourceGraph.com (http://sourcegraph.com/)), but now it can't, I make sure the context is my github username already

### Application Engineer Answer
â€‹
â€‹Hey, Mat! Unfortunately, as of August 1st, 2022 we have removed the ability of users to search personal repositories (both private and public) on sourcegraph.com. You are free however to spin up your own instance of Sourcegraph (https://about.sourcegraph.com/get-started/self-hosted). Here is the blog post that announced the change of Sourcegraph Cloud as a single-tenant cloud solution (https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/single-tenant-cloud). The post also makes note of the information I've shared above. I've shared an excerpt of the specific passage. ðŸ˜ƒ Please let me know if you have any other questions at all!
