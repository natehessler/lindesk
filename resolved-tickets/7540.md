## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer is having an issue with a new batch change. When he tries to create it he is getting repository does not exist for some repos we had moved so they really don’t exist. Doing the same query in the search bar there is no problem and it shows the results for the new ones. What he did now to test the spec is working is ignore them and all worked fine. He wants to know if there is a way to avoid that so it includes the new repos on the changes?

### Troubleshooting Steps
- Ran a quick search on the error in slack and found this [thread](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C01EDKVG9J5/p1643056016015200?thread_ts=1643052186.014100&cid=C01EDKVG9J5) helpful


### Resolution
- This is most likely a result of a defect that has been [fixed and merged](https//sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/CHANGELOG.md?L175:186) into version 3.36.0.
- filtering out the repo would be the viable option pending when the upgrade is done.
