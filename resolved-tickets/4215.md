## Summary

###Customer Question



Hi @nate.maynard and @dan.ryan, we have some permissions questions about the interactions between sourcegraph’s batch changes and our code host (github).

https://docs.sourcegraph.com/batch_changes/how-tos/configuring_credentials#creating-a-code-host-tokenThis doc on creating personal access tokens for batch changes> says that the personal access token only requires read permissions. However, https://docs.sourcegraph.com/batch_changes/explanations/permissions_in_batch_changesthis doc on permissions in batch changes> very clearly states the following:
> Creating, updating, or publishing a batch change; or publishing a single changeset: You must have access to view the repositories and the configured token must have the rights to push a branch and create the changesets on your code host (e.g., push branches to and open pull requests on the GitHub repositories).
`the configured token must have the rights to push a branch and create the changesets on your code host (e.g., push branches to and open pull requests on the GitHub repositories).
^This section seems to create a direct conflict with the personal access token creation instructions. “the rights to push a branch and create changesets” implies write permissions, not just read. My personal access token that i’m using with src batch changes only has read permissions.

How exactly is it that sourcegraph is able to create any pull requests on our code hosts given this conflicting info?


### CSE Answer



So after talking with the team it seems as though the confusion lies with how GitHub outlines their permissions: “The first page talks about the GitHub token used by Batch Changes when pushing changes to the code host; the second talks about permissions on the batch change itself.”



The GitHub permissions outlined in the first doc will give write access to the token using the repo check box.
