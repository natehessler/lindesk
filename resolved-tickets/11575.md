## Summary
### Customer Question
The customer is running a batch spec and has it working when targeting specific repositories, but it fails with an error when he executes all repositories in their bitbucket project. He has logging and tracing enabled but still can't see what specific repo is failing/having issues. Based on the logs enabled, when he picks one of the repos with errors in the logs and then targets only that repo for a change it works. How do we figure out which repository is affected?

### Application Engineer Answer
In addition to the  flags `-keep-logs` and `-trace`  passed can you include the `-dump-requests` to see more details. You can also put `${{ repository.name }}` into the description field and see which repository it was failing on.
