## Summary
### Customer Question
I understand you are trying to get a list of contributors in a path present in a monorepo and will like to get a history of that. 

### Application Engineer Answer
I spent sometime hacking around this. You can make use of the graphql API to return a list of contributors to files in a path.
I tested out> with the following query on <http://sourcegraph.com|sourcegraph.com:

```
{
  repositories(names: "<http://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph|github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph>"){
    nodes{
      id
      name
      contributors(path: "doc/dependency_decisions.yml" ){
        nodes{
          person{
            name
            email
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  ```


The `contributors` also can make use of other fields and arguments as seen in the doc on the right side of the console.

Also, in the sourcegraph UI you can get history of a file by using the following either of the following shortcuts (`Alt + H` or `Opt + H`) or click on the Show/hide history icon
