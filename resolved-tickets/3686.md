## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue:  Inquiry about whether the customer needed to use the complete instructions in the k8s (management docs)[https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/config/advanced_config_file#kubernetes-configmap]

### Troubleshooting Steps:  N/a

### Resolution:  Clarified to customer that the docs are repetitious


>Hey Kevin, this doc is a bit repetitious The instructions for kubernetes repeat the env vars that need to be set in the frontend pods deployment yamls. The only unrepeated parts in the general instructions pertain to the ALLOW_EDITS env vars (if you'd like to allow edits you'll need to set these in the same way as the other env vars)
