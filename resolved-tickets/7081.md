## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Customer attempted to run a Batch Change with src cli and encountered an error, reporting that no searcher endpoints could be found.
 
### Troubleshooting Steps
I asked the customer for the current number of searcher replicas and repos in their current deployment. They didn't have access to that information, and tagged in a teammate who would. Unfortunately, the teammate never responded.
 
### Resolution
The customer attempted the Batch Change again later in the day, and it worked just fine. There have been no further issues, so I shared the docs page about scaling a Kubernetes deployment in case this resurfaces.
