## Summary
### Customer Question
Is there JSONNET syntax highlighting? It appears that all the JSONNET files do not have syntax highlighting

### Application Engineer Answer
I did a quick test on my end, and I can also confirm that the jsonnet files do not have syntax highlighting. I can confirm that we currently don't have syntax highlighting for JSONNET files. This would go for a feature request
