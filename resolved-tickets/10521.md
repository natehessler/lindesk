## Summary
### Customer Question
Is this file somehow not indexed?
If I search sub-strings that I know exist in the file, I get no results.

### Application Engineer Answer
​
​File size was also what I am leaning towards.
Files that are over 1MB are excluded from search results.
It is possible that this file has increased in size over time.
Can you verify that the file is under 1MB?

//////CUSTOMER RESPONSE/////////
​Thanks, @Alex Jean-Baptiste.
I wasn't aware of that limitation.
That's the cause, the file just passed the 1MiB mark (1,053,760 bytes).
