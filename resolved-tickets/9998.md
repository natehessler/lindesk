## Summary
### Customer Question
Do we need to be on a particular version of Sourcegraph for scip indexes to work (we're running 3.39.0 right now)? The announcement mentions that the Sourcegraph backend processes only LSIF, so presumably, I just need a newer version of the src cli to convert and upload the index to Sourcegraph, I don't need to update Sourcegraph itself?

### Application Engineer Answer
You will need the latest src which accepts and convert the scip index. Support for scip was added to src-cli in 3.40.0.
