​

### Application Engineer Answer
​
​Hello folks!After consulting with the Batch Changes team I have next steps for you on the was submitted too quickly  error.I would like to revisit my previous assumption about the rollout window rate being too fast.I have researched the issue and it is indeed coming from the GitHub code host.It is an error that occurs due an undocumented object creation rate limiting against the GitHub platform.In regards to the 65 changesets being created at once that number of PRs would go directly against even the documented GitHub rate limit
which is 5000 requests an hour.5000 requests an hour => ~83/minute, or ~1.3/secondPublishing 5 changesets a minute a second would push against that rate limit.That also doesn’t take into account other interactions with GitHub being done with your PAT.So starting with changing the rate of the rollout window to 5/minute and increasing steadily to find the rate that is fastest without exacerbating the code host is the step I recommend next.As of right now, we do not believe this error to be related to webhooks.Again, we believe it to be a rate limit issue caused by the code host itself.
