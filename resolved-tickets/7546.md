## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer reported that a they were not seeing any search results from within a file, despite being able to find the file itself.

### Application Engineer Answer
The file itself was smaller than 1MB, but after checking in with the search team, we were able to determine that the file had not been indexed because of a large number of unique trigrams. The customer updated `search.largeFiles` in their site configuration and are now seeing search results.
