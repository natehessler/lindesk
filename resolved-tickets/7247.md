## Summary
### Customer Question
Is it possible to use GitHub App to allow sourcegraph access to your  organization / private repos.

### Application Engineer Answer
At the moment, it is not possible to use a GitHub App. This is an effort underway right now and hopefully this would be available soon. 
Today, users can either:
- Connect with GitHub and add repos as an individual through OAuth
- Create an organization (in the limited access) and use connect with GitHub with a PAT, where the PAT belongs to themselves or machine account
