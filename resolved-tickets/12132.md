## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer was searching for some dependencies files but I am not having all the results, particularly from a  repo.
### Troubleshooting Steps
- Are you able to search for this repo in the sourcegraph UI?
- Are you able to access this repo in your code host?

### Resolution
The user is not able to see the repo in the code host.
The user does not have access to the repo because it does not belong to the team. This is a private repo and only people with access can view the repo.
