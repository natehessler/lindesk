## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer noticed recurrent payload for webhook events would return a 500 error. Specifically these were:  "action": "synchronize" , "action": "opened" , "action": "edited" and would return the following exact error * unknown changeset event kind for <nil> 
### Troubleshooting Steps
Looked through the codebase to see how we handled these types of errors and came across this. In addition, we also didn't have the above actions specified in our ChangesetEventKinds here. This is not a blocker for changesets though
### Resolution
This is undesirable behavior and resulted in a fix here: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/32984
