## Summary
### Customer Question
Is there a limit to, or a way to, search/for searching large files? Or is there a limit for file types?

### Application Engineer Answer
Doesn't seem like there's a file type restriction. As for file size, files larger than 1mb are currently excluded from search (as described in a following documentation-link).

To include them in a search, one would need to configure search to accept `search.largeFiles` , which is a [setting](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/explanations/search_details#max-file-size) in the [site config](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/config/site_config#search-largeFiles).
