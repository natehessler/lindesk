## Summary
### Customer Question
​
​We have a user trying to run a changeset through the src-cli
Failed to run operations on changeset
Post "<http://gitserver-0.gitserver:3178/create-commit-from-patch>": dial tcp: lookup gitserver-0.gitserver on 10.96.0.10:53: no such host


We are seeing this error.

### Application Engineer Answer
​
​Back with a follow up @ryan.currah
Historically we have seen a no such host error coming from gitserver when performing Batch Changes when the memory allocation for gitserver is too low.
Are there any memory usage alerts popping up for gitserver in Grafana?
You can check this by navigating to the following.
Top Right Profile Icon > Site Admin > Maintenance > Monitoring
This Grafana homepage should show alerts for gitserver (See attached screenshot)
Please share a screenshot of this page so that I can either confirm the type of alert or lack of.

Ultimately the gitserver pod was not up after performing an upgrade to 4.0.1. It took a bit longer, and when up, the error disappeared. The update policy on gitserver is also being updated by the customer.
