## Summary

### Customer Question

Hi! I was looking at https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/sentry and I was wondering if there’s a way to pass a per project based URL for self hosted sentry servers. I’ve looked at the docs and it’s pretty good on configuring org/project but everything seems to point to cloud version of sentry. Is that correct?
### Application Engineer Answer

Hi. Back with an update.It seems that currently we only have the option for the cloud version for Sentry available for use based on this I took a look at a couple of examples and all saw that they pointed to organizations within sentry.io

"sentry.organization": "<the_sentry_organization>",
