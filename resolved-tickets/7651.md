## Summary
### Customer Question
[The customer] was just asking us over Zoom about how to optimize for Garbage collection - possible to advise on this?

### Application Engineer Answer
​If I am understanding correctly, you are looking to optimize the performance of the gitserver  garbage collection job.In Sourcegraph 3.36 we introduced an sg maintenance  job in order to optimize the gitserver garbage collection for large monorepos. Upgrading to this version of Sourcegraph is the way to activate this feature.
