## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer wanted to know how to make sourcegraph available to other users in their company. From reading past messages, it seems like the value for externalURL may have been set to something local, which is why other users could not acess it. 
### Application Engineer Answer
I asked the customer if they could share what value they have set for externalURL. I also asked if they were using port forwarding to access the cluster on localhost and sent a couple of docs about setting up the external url. I didn't get a response about their value or if the docs were helpful but their CE reached out by email a few days later. The CE noticed that they had 5 unique users using the instance, which is a good sign that they were able to get other users to log on. Still no response from the customer but this can be taken as a sign that they do not have any other questions related to this.
