## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer was getting consistent HTTP 500 (internal server error) while running certain search queries.

### Troubleshooting Steps
Checked the Frontend/git server and repo-updater logs using the GCP-managed instance console.
Filter the logs from the time frame when the query was last run to identify the problematic repository.
From the logs, I could see error messages depicting the issue with indexing the repo and it's being not able to be processed by git-sever 
Created a github issue for the cloud team to remove and re-add the problematic repository as this is a managed instance. Also informed team via slack channel.



### Resolution
Cloud team fixed the problematic repository using this opened github issue which resolved the problem for the customer.
