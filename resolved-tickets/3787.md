## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue:  

The user said they were unable to add sourcegraph as a search engine on firefox.



### Troubleshooting Steps:  

I was able to replicate the issue with multiple instances. sourcegraph.com was the only one I could add as a search engine. All others returned the error in the photo attached to this note.



### Resolution:  

I searched for known issues and found this: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/5627.  Closed at the time I discovered it, I let extensibility know that it was still an issue. They re-opened the issue and are working on it now. I sent the customer a link to the public issue so that they can follow.
