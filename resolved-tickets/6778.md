## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer was searching `"mobile payments not enabled for this account"` and was getting zero results when they are expecting exactly one result
### Application Engineer Answer
Their understanding was that using quotes would do a literal search that considers all the text as one long string. In reality, they were searching for instances of `"mobile payments` and excluding instances containing `enabled for this account"`. They were able to get the results they wanted by enabling regular expressions but in the future they can also use the `content:` filter before their string.
