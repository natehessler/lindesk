## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer wants to setup code monitor to check for Slack API tokens in code.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- I reproduced the issue and noticed that when I ran the above query in the UI with the `diff` parameter I got no results but when I included the `repo` parameter I was able to get results.
### Resolution
 Including a `repo` parameter shows the `diff` from repositories matching the search pattern and that way you can monitor changes to token in repositories matching the pattern.
