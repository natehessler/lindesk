## Summary

### Customer Question



Is there a way to explicitly set a default branch for a repo?



For example, our deploy-sourcegraph repository has both master and twitter-master. We'd prefer that a search query would automatically search twitter-master instead of master

### Application Engineer Answer



This is accomplished with either search contexts or setting the default branch for the repository on the code host.
