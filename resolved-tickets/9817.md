## Summary
### Customer Question
​
​Hi team. Hope you all are doing well!
How can I get data about the usage of sourcegraph in Glovo? like number of searches, daily or weekly active users, etc.?
Thank you

### Application Engineer Answer
​
​Hello, Yaser!That data is limited to the Sourcegraph Site Admin view.If you are a Site Admin for your Sourcegraph instance you can find this data by navigating to your profile picture in the top right corner and clicking Site Admin.Once you’re on that screen you can then click on Usage Stats under Statistics :simple_smile:
