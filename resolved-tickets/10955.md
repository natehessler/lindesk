## Summary
### Customer Question
​
​Usually when we run batch changes, the actual code to be executed is relatively simple, and we define it inline in the batch spec. What if we wanted to run a more complicated script, potentially made up of a few files? Is there a way to do that without pasting the context of the files into file path keys under the `files` key for the given container?
I thought I remembered seeing an example for a locally executed batch change that was able to find a file in the same directory as the batch spec itself and use that code, but it's been awhile.

### Application Engineer Answer
​
After talking with some folks and looking over our docs.
step.mount is actually the key that you would like to use for the use case that you mentioned.
