## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer just curious about stability of our https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm 

### Application Engineer Answer
At the time of asking, it was not stable. [README.md](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/blob/2a6db4dcbbab4e542fcea57995fd03957c3e295a/README.md) in the repo, at the time of the question, reads:

> This is an experimental project. NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN PRODUCTION. Instead, use one of Sourcegraph's supported deployment methods.

Though, worth noting, general availabiity (GA) of Helm was [announced](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C01PX32TK1S/p1649445849921439)  shortly after to be available April 25th.
