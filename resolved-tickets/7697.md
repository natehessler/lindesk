## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer wanted to know if sourcegraph has any practices in place for uploading compile-time generated source files, separate from the repo they originated from
### Application Engineer Answer
We do not, reached out to CE who is engaging with the customer from there. Currently, these files are ignored by sourcegraph (customer has them in their gitignore). They don't want to upload them to github within each repo because this will clutter things up for them. Another option would be to create a separate repo to hold all compile-time generated files but this would require additional set up on their end.
### Relevant Docs Pages Used/Created
https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/external_service/non-git <-- possible workaround using `src-expose` but this is not an attractive option for them because of the setup required to get this working the way they want
