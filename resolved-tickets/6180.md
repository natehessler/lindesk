## Summary
### Customer Question
I'm trying to find all occurrences of subdomain.domain.extension that aren't subdomainXXX.domain.extension.  So (?<!subdomainXXX)\.domain\.extension ? Does sourcegraph support negative lookbehinds in queries? 

### Application Engineer Answer
I can confirm that we currently don't support a negative look behind syntax. however, I think an alternative that may work in your case is  excluding specific characters using the [^abc] convention. however, you would have to explicitly exclude the characters that are xxx but then permit everything that is almost xxx. I have been trying a couple of workarounds to basically match "https://subdomain.domain.extension". This  https:\/\/subdomain[.].* can return a match of
subdomain.domain.extension. It would also return files where both subdomain.domain.extension and subdomainXXX.domain.extension but this search query would only match subdomain.domain.extension. I hope this can be a good alternative for you .
