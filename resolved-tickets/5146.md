## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

Customer was not receiving metrics for 99th percentile successful search request duration over 5m or 90th percentile successful search request duration over 5m.



### Troubleshooting Steps

See attached issue.



### Resolution

Response from search team in the issue: 



"Alright, this turns out to be related to the fact that we never updated those two panels to use the streaming search metrics. We migrated the UI to use streaming search, instead of the GraphQL API one year ago. Search usage of the GraphQL API is now restricted to extensions, batch changes, code insights and and code monitors, but not user traffic from the search UI.
We will push an updated dashboard in the next release."
