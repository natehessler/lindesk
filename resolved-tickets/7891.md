## Summary
### Customer Question
> hello Sourcegraph folks!  I had an interesting question come up and thought I'd ask you for input:
>
> `What's my best bet for extracting information from a Source Graph search to a spreadsheet? I found the "search-export" extension, but it only captures a fraction of the results I see on the web page? Thanks!`
>
> I am curious what your recommendations are and if you know why the search-export would produce differing results


### Application Engineer Answer
> The reason you see different result numbers is because the UI makes use of our [Stream API](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/api/stream_api), while the search export extension uses our internal GraphQL API. To optimize speed, the GraphQL API has a cap of 30 results, but you can override that with an exhaustive search.
>
> Include `count:all` in your search query, and then search export will include all the results that you see in the UI!
