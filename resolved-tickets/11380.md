## Summary
### Customer Question
In Batch Changes, is there any support for targeting repositories based on GitHub Topics?

### Application Engineer Answer
The short answer is, we do a lot of optimizations to make Batch Changes as fast as possible. When starting a batch change, Sourcegraph clones a shallow copy with a depth of 1 so that we only get the commit we really need. It leaves out everything else in the git history. This means we also don't fetch tags (or labels, i.e. GitHub Topics)
