## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

The customer was having issues trying to get HTTPS to work sourcegraph.


### Troubleshooting Steps
Asked the customer to check the caddy logs, for any errors.
The Customer ran docker exec -it caddy caddy validate  and it spat out validate: decoding config: unexpected end of JSON input



### Resolution
I came across this [thread](https://caddy.community/t/caddy-validate-unexpected-end-of-json-input/11827) and the customer and I agree this is a more caddy-specific question.
