## Summary

### Customer Question

what are the limitations of using the single docker container in prod?
Is there a simpler docker-compose file with just the required components (no grafana and stuff) that I can use?

### Application Engineer Answer
We do not recommend using a single docker container for a production instance.  
To test Sourcegraph in a low-resource environment you may want to disable some of the observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger).
Add -e DISABLE_OBSERVABILITY=true to your docker run command.
If deploying a production instance, We recommend Docker Compose for most initial production deployments then you can now migrate to another type of [deployments](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install). 
The [resource estimator](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/resource_estimator) tool is also a good starting point for your deployment. 
Currently, The docker-compose.yaml file currently depends on configuration files that live in the repository, so you must have the entire repository cloned onto your server to deploy sourcegraph with docker-compose. 
we strongly recommend that you create and run Sourcegraph from your own fork of the [reference repository](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/docker-compose#reference-repository) to track customizations to the [Sourcegraph Docker Compose YAML](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml). 
This will make [upgrades](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/docker-compose/operations#upgrade) far easier.
