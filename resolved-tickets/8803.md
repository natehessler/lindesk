## Summary
### Customer Question
How do we access databases on our sourcegraph instance?

### Application Engineer Answer
First, you have to have admin privileges on your cloud provider, so that you can ssh into the instance. After you've ssh'd into the instance, all you have to do is ssh into the shell that corresponds with the DB you want to access.

kubectl exec -it <database name> -n <namespace> psql -U <sg or postgres for codeinsights-db>
