## Summary
### Customer Question

Hi, quick question / feature request: is there a way in Sourcegraph to increase the number of lines of context before and after the match in the search results? If not, if would be great to add that feature. The code search tool I used at my last company had this and I find myself really missing it now.

Hi @Iwona Bialynicka-Birula,
I replicated and tested this locally you can achieve this by changing the value of search.contextLines defined in user settings on your source graph instance. By default, it is set to 3. You can access the settings by clicking on the dropdown in the top right corner.
Attaching a reference screenshot of the user setting change from my run.
I also found an open feature request here, which is about making this more convenient for users.
Hope this helps!
