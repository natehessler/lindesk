## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer saw a 'Can't connect to GitHub'. This error was caused when the external sync was marked as errored because GitHub returned a 404 when we reach the end of pagination. This was fixed in https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/710   
Another issue was caused when the database reached the max value for type integer. 
It looks like we reached the int limit of 2,147,483,647.

### Troubleshooting Steps
The thing that stands out to me is the repositoryQuery: public method of adding repos. I see here that the repo list is built by querying the API 100 repos at a time. Though I don't see what the exit condition is. If you visit the page that creates the error it does return a 404. https://github.com/api/v3/repositories?per_page=100&since=66941
I tested this a bit on ghe.sgdev.org and I could see that anything past 442286 returned a 404.
I tried to query another GHE API and anything past the last repo returned an empty array instead of a 404 page.
This leads me to believe that there are no repos past 66941 so GitHub returns a 404, and the function exits here.
https://github.com/api/v3/repositories?per_page=100&since=66940 returns a single repo which is the repo with id 66941.
