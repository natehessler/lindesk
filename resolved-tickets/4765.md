## Summary

### Customer Question
The Customer wants to know what is the difference between "Last active" and "Last active in code host or code review" in usage statistics


### Application Engineer Answer

The last active gives information about when last a user was actively using Sourcegraph. While Last active in code hostor code review gives information about when last a particular user used Sourcegraph in the code host. For example, researching, reviewing code, and code intel in the code host. If the browser extension is installed and configured to point to your SG URL, in your code host for repos present in your Sourcegraph instance you should see the sourcegraph logo. This means you can use code review on your code host and these stats would update on the usage statistics page.
