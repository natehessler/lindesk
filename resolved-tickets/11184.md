## Summary
### Customer Question
Seems like quick links are deprecated in 4.0.0. Are there alternatives?

### Application Engineer Answer
An alternative would be to use notices in the global settings. These render markdown and using location:home will show the notice under the search bar.

```
"notices": [
     {
     "dismissible": true,
     "location": "home",
       "message": "markdown"
     },
  ],
```
