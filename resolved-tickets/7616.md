## Summary
### Customer Question
> Does sourcegraph just index code or does it have integrations with GitHub such that you can, say, search across PR comments?


### Application Engineer Answer
> Currently, it is not possible to search across PR comments - though if you weren't already aware, you can search through [commit messages](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/explanations/features#commit-message-search).

I tagged in their CE to handle the feature request
