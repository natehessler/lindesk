## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
Hi Team, is there any changes on sourcegraph 4.0.1 for enabling GitLab OAuth?
```A Sourcegraph license is required to enable the following authentication providers: GitLab OAuth. Get a license.```

### Troubleshooting Steps
- Since this is your staging instance, you do not have a license configured on this instance which explains the error.

- The error you shared says you are unable to enable GitLab as an authentication provider due to your license.

### Resolution
Usually, you do not need an enterprise license when you have less than 10 users however you do when you have 10+ users. They got a license for their staging instance and it works.
