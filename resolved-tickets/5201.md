## Summary

### Customer Question

"how do I know the "Sourcegraph instance URL" if I want to validate it through the src CLI?"


### Application Engineer Answer

"Assuming that you are a Site Admin, you can set an externalURL by going to Site admin > Configuration > Site configuration. The value that you provide for externalURL should be usable as the "Sourcegraph instance URL" that src-cli asks for. It may also be necessary to preface it with https:// ."
