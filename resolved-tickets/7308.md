## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer thought that repo permissions were not syncing
### Application Engineer Answer
Customer had to set `allowGroupsPermissionsSync: true` and `groupsCacheTTL: 72`. Through running the following query to confirm that there were no repos without permissions and by having a few users try searches and checking the result count, we confirmed that repo permissions seem to be fine. 
```
SELECT
  COUNT(repo.name)
FROM
   repo
   LEFT JOIN repo_pending_permissions ON repo.id = repo_pending_permissions.repo_id
   LEFT JOIN repo_permissions ON repo.id = repo_permissions.repo_id
WHERE
  repo.private
  AND repo.deleted_at IS NULL
  AND ARRAY_LENGTH(repo_pending_permissions.user_ids_ints, 1) = 0
  AND ARRAY_LENGTH(repo_permissions.user_ids_ints, 1) = 0;
```
