## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
We frequently see a warning-level alert in Grafana for less than 5 connections active over 5 minutes. I'm not sure how to investigate whether the alert needs adjusting or this is genuinely a degraded service.

### Troubleshooting Steps
N/A

### Resolution
Hi Hunter,

I'm happy to help out with this.

I believe you are on version v3.40.2. I apologize for this warning that you're seeing. It's actually something that's on our radar here that we are actively looking at changing since it's related to codeinsights database metrics getting pulled into the Postgres dashboard.

This is the pesky PromQL query;
sum by (job) (pg_stat_activity_count{datname!~"template.*|postgres|cloudsqladmin"}) OR sum by (job) (pg_stat_activity_count{job="codeinsights-db", datname!~"template.*|cloudsqladmin"})

As a workaround for this at the moment(until we remove it), I suggest that you please silence this alert by adding;
"observability.silenceAlerts": [
  "warning_postgres_connections"
]

in your site admin configuration.

Happy to confirm that this is not a degraded service or a blocker on your instance since we've done the same to our internal instances as well.

Cheers!
