## Summary
### Customer Question

​Is there a way to get usage data in more detail? For example a level of daily activity and perhaps even the actual searches that were conducted? For the moment I seem to only be able to get total search count of the user over all time. There's also no way to tell if the searches were scoped to codehosts or repos which are all important in determining user personas and helping to drive adoption and providing training in the right areas.
​
### Application Engineer Answer
​
After collaboration with my colleagues we have determined that he best option currently would be to use the information at the following url:[SOURCEGRAPH SITE URL]/users/<username>/settings/event-logThis url will show you more granular site usage for a specific user.
​
​After looking at the api route for UserEventLogs in our code base what we have is a query that is constructed per User in which the eventLogs are bound to each individual user.Does that query in our codebase help at all in figuring out how you programmatically achieve the same?
