## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer was trying to get sourcegraph chrome extension to work on our code repo. It appears that sg has full access to our git enterprise but I don’t see any code intelligence pop up when I hover within our codebase.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- Can you confirm on your Sourcegraph instance if the programming language extensions are enabled.
- is this repo cloned and searchable on your Sourcegraph instance and are you able to get code intel on this repo in Sourcegraph?
- In addition to the above, In the [documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension) on the extension, there is a section for [troubleshooting](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension#troubleshooting) issues like this, It might be good to start to ensure everything checks right!

### Resolution
The problem auto resolved itself after the user signed out and signed back in
