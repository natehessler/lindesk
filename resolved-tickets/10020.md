## Summary
### Customer Question
If I search for repo:^github\.com/golang/go$ type:commit rev:ceefd3a37bb2a77b1e9a76fc74360c68ef16ddb8 I get back a long list of revisions, not just the one that I am searching for.  Is there a way to only get back the commit that I asked for?

### Application Engineer Answer
Customer mentioned that they would only need this to work for one commit. Since they didn't need a dynamic solution, I mentioned that they could append count:1 to their search, which would return the latest commit message at this revision. This solved the issue.
 
Note that this may not be a good long-term solution.
