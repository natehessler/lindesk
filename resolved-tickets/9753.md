## Summary
### Customer Question
Sourcegraph Support - Need help with alert [CRITICAL] frontend: 5s+ 90th percentile blob load latency over 10m
Critical alert 'blob_load_latency' is firing for service 'frontend' (core application).
We are getting this alert intermittently. Need help to understand the cause.
Don't see any high utilisation as such on frontend pods

### Application Engineer Answer

The reason could be that due to network activity on the 14th, the repo updater was trying to reclone repositories that went unavailable due to network outage and while handling these requests git-server went under pressure triggering the alerts.
