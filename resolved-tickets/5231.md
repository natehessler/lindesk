## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue

#### Steps to reproduce:

1. User reported seeing the following error messages in their grafana logs.

**A)**
```
t=2021-12-20T08:50:32+0000 lvl=eror msg="Failed to read content of symlinked path" logger=provisioning.dashboard type=file name=sourcegraph_additional path=/sg_grafana_additional_dashboards error="lstat /sg_grafana_additional_dashboards: no such file or directory"
```
**B)**
```
{"@level":"debug","@message":"datasource: registering query type fallback handler","@timestamp":"2021-12-21T13:58:50.856483Z"}
t=2021-12-21T13:58:50+0000 lvl=eror msg="Failed to read plugin provisioning files from directory" logger=provisioning.plugins path=/sg_config_grafana/provisioning/plugins error="open /sg_config_grafana/provisioning/plugins: no such file or directory"
```
A) `/sg_grafana_additional_dashboards: no such file or directory` was due to it being an optional directory per [the docs here:](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/metrics#grafana-configuration)

The work around to no longer seeing that error was to mount an empty directory.

```
- mountPath: /sg_grafana_additional_dashboards
          name: additional-dashboard
- name: additional-dashboard
        emptyDir: {}
```

3. This error B) `/sg_config_grafana/provisioning/plugins: no such file or directory`, I could not find this directory listed in the docs. I reasoned it's optionally for Grafana plugins.

### Troubleshooting Steps

* Check the grafana logs. When do these error messages appear? Only at the start when first restarted?
* What version is the customer on? Has the fix in the above PR been implemented? (as of writing this its open)
* Has the customer failed to mount the optional directories? These ones:

```
RUN mkdir /sg_grafana_additional_dashboards
RUN mkdir /sg_config_grafana/provisioning/plugins
```

### Resolution

* It depends!!

  * Upgrade to a later version that mounts these directories (TBD as of this second)
  * Mount an empty directory in the path like above
  * Ignore the warnings because customer doesn't care about plugins or extra dashboards

### Relevant Docs Pages Used/Created

* Add a doc page here.
