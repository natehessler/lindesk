## Summary
### Customer Question
Is there a way to do nested searches in Sourcegraph?
For example, we have a file with the following line: `<PackageReference Include="Azure.Storage.Common" Version="$(Azure_Storage_Common)" />`, I want to capture the value `Azure_Storage_Common` (which is a variable whose name can vary from one team to the next) & use it to search for the version number in another file `<Azure_Storage_Common>12.9.0</Azure_Storage_Common>`.

### Application Engineer Answer
can confirm that this isn't supported. Although, we can do some interesting things with structural search if the terms are in the same file, but we currently don’t support any nested or pipelined queries right now.
