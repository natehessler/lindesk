## Summary

### Customer Question

"...what port should I use to access the sourcegraph UI on my ec2 instance?"


### Application Engineer Answer

I suggested the user to try either port `80` or `443`. The user seemed to find success with port 80. The source/evidence for these guesses was found in the documentation (linked below).
