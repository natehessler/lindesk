## Summary

### Customer Question
"We have lots of starlark files in our code base. Is ther any way to get Souregraph's indexer to treat these files like python?"

Said in a different way, is there a way to get Sourcegraph's indexing to treat files of one language as a different language instead?


### Application Engineer Answer

No, unfortunately. This was pinged to the Customer Engineer as a feature request.
