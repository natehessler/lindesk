## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
- customer reports a single repo is failing to clone to their Sourcegraph instance
### Troubleshooting Steps
- Customer is on a managed instance, so I collected repo-updater logs.
- These logs had no mention of the affected repo
- I then checked their database for any mention of the repo, and also found none
- This suggests the repo has never been cloned or attempted to clone to their Sourcegraph instance
### Resolution
- I asked the customer to check with their IT department to confirm if the repo has unusual permissions that would prevent Sourcegraph from finding it.  This was the case, and their IT department resolved the issue by changing the repo permissions.
