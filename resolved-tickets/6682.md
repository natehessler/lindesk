## Summary
### Customer Question

QQ if you have multiple overlays, like namespaced and the non-privy one, does the order on how you apply them matter at all?

### Application Engineer Answer

Hey @Bill.i.am generally speaking if your using our generate cluster script (docs), you'll only be working with one overlay to apply all the customizations you're looking for. When you want to use multiple overlay you can essentially stack them using the resources: field, heres an example snippet from a custom overlay I was using --
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
namespace: ns-sourcegraph

resources:
  - ../non-privileged

# frontend
- patch: |-
    - op: replace
      path: /spec/selector

Also note that for our supplied non-privileged overlay does specify a namespace, so you can change that field, you'll want to generate the cluster using the non-priv create overlays (docs)Let me know if that helps out a bit, or if you've got any follow up questions
