## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
n particular we're observing some "interesting":thinking_face: behavior be in our gitserver metrics.Relevant data point: A few days ago (17-Jun), we have bumped available memory from 14G to 22G
Current observations (see screenshots):
Shard 0 and 2 have stepped up in memory significantly since 20-Jun ~16:40. And another step just now. What's suddenly happening here? Also, there's a very significant network spike at the same point in time (see screenshot with zoomed in timeline)
Shard 1 seems to be still garbage collecting frequently (~1/hour). It was more frequent before though. Is this an indication it needs even more memory?
Hope you can help us to understand what we see, and better tune the system.
### Troubleshooting Steps
Grab gitserver and repo-updater logs
