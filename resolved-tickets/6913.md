## Summary
### Customer Question
we want to make sure once a user is getting disconnected from our Github organization his user will automatically be deleted from Sourcegraph. how can we make this happen?

### Application Engineer Answer
If Github User authentication (SSO) is set up on your Sourcegraph instance and you have the ` "allowOrgs": ["your-org-name"] ` enabled in the auth.providers section in your site config this would restrict logins and signups  to members of your organisation. You would have to manually remove this inactive accounts from your SG instance.
