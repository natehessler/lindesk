## Summary

### Customer Question

Is there a way to seed the search ranking algorithm
### Application Engineer Answer

No it's not possible to do that but using search contexts can help constrain the number of repos. You can, however, create contexts that are shared across the org that contain the subset of repos,  talking , and they wouldn’t have to have each dev recreate them in their own Sourcegraph contexts.
