## Summary
### Customer Question
If we start a new instance, say 3.35, can we import the data from our instance in 3.28 so that we don't have to upgrade sequentially?

### Application Engineer Answer
Unfortunately, no. The migrations from version to version are too numerous, and will leave you with a large amount of dirty database errors that will be more trouble that it's worth.
