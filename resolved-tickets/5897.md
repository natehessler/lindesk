## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer found a difference in search results for both repo:contains.file and repohasfile filters. The results for both filters were as follows :

r:quotes-pkg r:contains.file(etc/FDS.*\.json) - 30 repositories
r:quotes-pkg repohasfile:etc/FDS.*\.json - 625 repositories
### Troubleshooting Steps
Run a simple regex query for a file using both filters.
### Resolution
This is a known bug and is currently under fix. The workaround is to substitute repo:contains.file(...) for repoHasFile:$file.ext until that the latter is deprecated. Just a quick note that repoHasFile is intended to sunset as soon as the challenges with contains.file(...) are resolved.
