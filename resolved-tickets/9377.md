## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
I tried to set up email alerts as described here, but I’m now seeing this error message.
Prometheus must be running though, since I can query it via the built in grafana
### Troubleshooting Steps
N/A
### Resolution
We did ship a fix here. 

We can add the following flag to the docker manifest as a workaround for now
-e PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:9090 (http://localhost:9090/)

The docker run command will then be:
docker run --publish 7080:7080 --publish 127.0.0.1:3370:3370 --rm --volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph -e PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:9090 (http://localhost:9090/) sourcegraph/server:3.34.2
