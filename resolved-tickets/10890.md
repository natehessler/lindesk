## Summary
### Customer Question
Tried to get the vscode extension work, but keep getting stuck with this error: <br />
Unrecognized patternType: 0xc0075ff0f0 <br />
I have a working “sourcegraph.accessToken” in my setting.json
### Application Engineer Answer
They were using v2.2.9 of the vs code extension which works with v3.40 and later. They had to downgrade to 2.2.7 to clear the error
