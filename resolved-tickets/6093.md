## Summary
### Customer Question
We don't see the Notebooks option under "Code Search". Is there something we need to do to activate it?

### Application Engineer Answer
The global settings should be something like this:
{
  "experimentalFeatures": {
    "codeInsights": true,
    "showSearchNotebook": true
  },
}
