## Summary
### Customer Question
​
Im trying to get an idea of our Go generics usage: ie type someType[T any] struct {. What is the recommended way to search for this kind of structure across a code base?
​

### Application Engineer Answer
​
​Hi @stephen.day!
It looks like the syntax for your structural search is slightly off. You can find a reference here, but for your case I would use a query like lang:go type :[~\w+][...] struct.
Structural search is nice for searches where exactness matters, but many people find the syntax a little difficult to grok. If you’re just doing some exploratory work, you might find regex a bit more familiar and something like lang:go /type \w+\[.*\] struct/ might work for your needs.
​
​@stephen.day I have used the following: lang:go /type \w+\[.*\] struct/ and received the results you are looking for.
