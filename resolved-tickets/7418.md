## Summary
### Customer Question
> I use a self-hosted sourcegraph instance which indexes 40+ repos.  I added some "context" to limit searches to some subsets of repos, but today i saw that I could also use "repo-groups" in my searches (after setting them up) to accomplish the same.  Is there any difference between the 2 approaches and which one should I use?


### Application Engineer Answer
> Repo groups accomplish the same thing as building search contexts targeting specific subsets of repositories. If that's the only filter you're looking to apply, it largely comes down to personal preference: do you want to select the predefined context from the dropdown for your search, or do you want to specify the repo group within your search query?
>
> We do generally recommend using contexts, since they're more flexible and allow for greater refinement than repo groups - especially since you're already making use of them. We have a whole page in the docs [here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/how-to/convert_repository_groups_to_search_contexts) explaining how to convert repo groups to search contexts, which includes the recommendation to discontinue using groups once the contexts have been set up.
