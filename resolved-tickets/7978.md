## Summary
### Customer Question
> Hi, for some reason I can't see any repos except personal repos inside sourcegraph. Is this a permission issue? Using the `fork` filter does nothing, I get the same type of results with `fork:yes` or `fork:no`


### Application Engineer Answer
Agreeing that this was likely a permissions issue, I requested that someone with admin access to the customer's instance check when their permissions were last synced. This revealed that there was a case mismatch on the customer's username. Admin updated the username to correct this, and resynced the customer's permissions, which resolved the issue.
