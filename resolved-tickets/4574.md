## Summary

### Customer Question

how can I check the number of cloned and indexed repositories?
How can I add a custom favicon?


### Application Engineer Answer

1. There are a number of ways you can check. 
  A. go to your profile in the top right corner then "site-admin" > "overview"
  B. "site-admin" > "repository status", where at the bottom of the list, you'll see the total number of repos. You can also use the filters to filter for cloned, not cloned and other filters.
  C. Lastly, you can get the number of repos from the src cli by using the command src search --stream "r: count:all
2. You can change the favicon by adding this bit of json to your site config at the first level of the config object: 

```branding: {
  favicon: <image url>
}```
