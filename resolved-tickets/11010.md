## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer complained about the new ref panel after opting in via the alert on the website. There wasn't a way to turn this off in the site config. The customer was agitated with this, but eventually found the workaround below:
 
### Resolution
1. Make note of your user name in the top right-hand corner of the UI when you click your profile photo.
2. Run SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '<username>'; and make note of the `id`
3. Run SELECT * FROM temporarysettings WHERE userid = <id from previous query>;
4. Find the entry that contains "codeintel.referencePanel.redesign.enabled": true in the JSON object in the content column, make note of the `id`.
5. Run DELETE FROM temporary_settings WHERE id = <id from previous query>;
This should revert back to the original ref panel.
 
### Relevant Docs Pages Used/Created
I don't think docs should be created for this. It should be fixed.
