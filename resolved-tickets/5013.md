## Summary

### Description of Customer Issue
A single user was unable to view repos, it appears to be the case that the users permissions were no longer synching.



### Troubleshooting Steps
Remove and re add the user 



### Resolution
Removing and re adding the user resolved the issue. However its unknown why the particular user was reporting issues seeing repos. A likely cause is a temporary outage of service in github around the same time that the issue manifested for the user. Note that this was also observed coinciding with the beginning of the thanksgiving holiday.
