## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
The customer deleted two insights from their dashboard.
​
1. select:repo file:yarn.lock archived:no fork:no
​
2. try {:[_]} catch (:[e]) {} finally {:[_]} lang:java patternType:structural archived:no fork:no
​
​
The customer then experienced continuous searcher evictions ever 30 - 60 minutes.
​
### Troubleshooting Steps
​
Unindexed searches were determined to be a dependency of Code Insights and therefore potentially related to the evictions taking place. The following query was run.
​
The primary database was queried using the following:
select count(*) from insights_query_runner_jobs where state in ('queued', 'processing', 'errored')
​

### Resolution

​The database entries that were returned were then updated using the following query:
     update insights_query_runner_jobs set state = 'terminated'
​
The customer reported no searcher evictions 72 hours post this update.
