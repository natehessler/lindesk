## Summary
The customer wanted to know if it's possible to work with external Postgres through a connection pooler. There is already an ongoing discussion around their external DB environment which is different from what we currently have.
And I noticed that Elzanne their CE is already working with the team to write a doc around their environment and she also jumped on this request to note the ongoing work which may be likely shared today. 

### Customer Question
