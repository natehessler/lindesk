## Summary
### Customer Question
They want to find all calls to a function that exclude a flag. Specifically:

"`DbxHiveRollupOperator(...sync_to_drone...) count:100`  but not sure how to search for the absence of `sync_to_drone`."

### Application Engineer Answer
Can't at this time. See discussion in the [RFH](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/795). Also [this dicussion](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/31454) around RegEx lookaround.
