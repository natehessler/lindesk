## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer got an error that the frontend failed to connect to codeinsights database
### Application Engineer Answer
Not sure what was causing an issue with codeinsights but we tried setting `DISABLE_CODE_INSIGHTS` to `true` to try to isolate the problem. On their own, the customer set `fsgroup` to 2000. they also found an issue with something on their k8s setup:
>Yes, we had a debug pod and deleted one of the rows in the schema_migrations and also went into the pgsql in codeintel postgres and ran the commands in the up.sql of that migration

Closed this ticket due to no response from the customer but I'm guessing the k8s issue was the problem. Unclear if they still kept codeinsights disabled.
