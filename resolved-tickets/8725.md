## Summary
### Customer Question
Question on batch changes. Is there a concept of multi commit change? basically a way to commit in between run steps?

### Application Engineer Answer
It’s not possible to run multiple commits in one batch change. What Batch Changes does is:  
Generate the diff locally,  
Send it to the Sourcegraph instance,  
then, the Sourcegraph instance creates a commit and uses the configured credentials to push it to a branch and open a changeset.
