## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer wanted to know if they can scale down from their `db.r6g.2xlarge` instance when setting up their deployment
### Application Engineer Answer
I wanted to avoid giving a direct suggestion for a smaller instance in case it is not appropriate for their repos/repo size/etc so I suggested the resource estimator so they can see what is recommended. Their CE commented in the thread after me and said they can scale down to `db.r6g.xlarge` and scale up later if necessary
