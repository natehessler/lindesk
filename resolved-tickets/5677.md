## Summary
### Customer Question
Customer reported that they configured an email server but were not receiving email alerts when they tested with their API console, as recommended by this [doc](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/alerting#testing-alerts). 
Their goal is for these emails to be used for notification-generating features like code monitoring or batch change status updates. <-- possibly a use case for managed instances that we hadn't considered
### Application Engineer Answer
They first tried changing settings under email.smtp, specifially the port number  ðŸ‘Ž 
Later we thought setting noverifyTLS to true might work but enabling TLS on our end would expose our SMTP server password so ðŸ‘Ž <br />
Finally resolved through a call with engineering: After going through the flow, they noticed that events were not firing as expected and it was discovered that the frontend pods were out of sync with the configuration. After remediating this, email alerts worked successfully.
