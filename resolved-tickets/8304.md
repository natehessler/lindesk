## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
I see sourcegraph is out of date pretty often lately, at least twice in the past few days.

### Troubleshooting Steps
Checked repo-updater and gitserver and saw the errors below.


### Resolution
The Access Token was expired. Updating the access token made gitserver update the repos successfully.

failed to fetch: failed to update with output \"remote: Invalid username or password.\\nfatal: Authentication failed
