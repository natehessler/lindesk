## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
After installing the browser extension, When the user navigates to phabricator, code intel does not pop up on any of the files.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- I took some time to reproduce this issue.
- I am able to get code intel pop-ups. So I am trying to figure out what the issue is.
- I want to confirm if the steps in this [docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/how-to/test_phabricator#browser-extension) are followed accordingly for configuring browser extension.
- Does your browser extension has permission to access the Phabricator instance.
- Also, do you see the following sourcegraph logo on any of the files in the connected repo.

### Resolution
we had a live debugging session. In the code host config, the configuration wasn’t done properly.
Using this [docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/how-to/test_phabricator#browser-extension) we were able to get the configs right and the user is now able to get code intel.
