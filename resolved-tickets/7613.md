## Summary
### Customer Question
> we want to see on the batch changes page also the code owner of each repo, is it possible?


### Application Engineer Answer
> This isn't currently possible, I'm afraid. I'll tag in your customer engineer so he can share the idea with the relevant teams for them to consider.
