## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue
- Issue 1: Some repos failed to create the batch
 - Issue 2: Pagination on the batch change detail page
-  Issue 3: Most changesets have a failed status but PR created on GitHub: 

### Troubleshooting Steps
# Issue 1: Some repos failed to create the batch
- Are there any specific error messages you get before this timeout window?
- Does your access token have the right scopes to make changes to these repos.
- Do you have access to some of this failing repos in your codehost?
- In your gitserver logs are you seeing any errors related to batch?
# Issue 2: Pagination on the batch change detail page
- I'd appreciate it if I can get a screen record of this behavior to better understand what you are seeing and share this feedback internally.
# Issue 3: Most changesets have a failed status but PR created on GitHub:
- Ideally, if the changeset fails when clicking on the dropdown arrow beside the checkbox by each changeset and you should see detailed info on the cause of failure but in your case its not giving any info which is a bit weird and the fact that the PRs where created on GitHub successfully makes it an interesting scenario.

### Resolution
We kind of figured out ways to go around issue by running the batch multiple times if necessary. For the pagination, I noticed there is a `visible` query param I can use to always load the right number of changesets and for issue #3, turns out it was the status from the checks on GitHub.
