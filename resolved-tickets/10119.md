## Summary
### Description of Customer Issue

Dropbox after experimenting with indexing and uploading their monorepo with scip-python found that their frontend was periodically stalling out

### Troubleshooting Steps

Frontend logs, database logs, jumping on call to view the database activity via the RDS developers console. 

After successfully pulling logs from the external database and correlating this to observed database failovers, we found a particular code-intelligence query which was overusing the resources on the database -- learn morei n the github issue linked

### Resolution

The RDS instance was moved to a larger machine, and since then no failovers and subsequent frontend stall outs have been observed.
