## Summary
### Customer Question
Hi folks, for https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/deploy_executors in v4.0 is there Kubernetes support planned?
We run our sourcegraph via Kubernetes, is there something specific about the Kubernetes execution model that you don’t like?

### Application Engineer Answer
This is a request that may potentially go on the roadmap.

### Relevant Docs Pages Used/Created
If you want to run on kubernetes today, docker in docker can work (at least did in exploration), if your kubernetes nodes run docker and not containerd. It’s not yet documented though.
The blessed way today is running them on separate machines with our provided terraform modules or by setting up the machines yourself, which is also documented well now
