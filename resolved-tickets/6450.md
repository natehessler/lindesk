## Summary
### Customer Question

Why can't I use Structural search with yml files? I don't get the results I expect?!?!

### Application Engineer Answer

The reason is because structural search uses Comby and is designed for other languages like Go, Java, JSON, etc
That’s why it doesn’t work quite the same with Yaml / Yml files: Sourcegraph structural search.

> Matching blocks in indentation-sensitive languages. It’s not currently possible to match blocks of code that are indentation-sensitive. This is a feature planned for future work.
