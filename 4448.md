## Summary
### Customer Question
I decided to work on issue https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/25216 , it has to do with the signup page which I couldn't access locally so I made changes using devtools to get the view in the second image, if I make the changes locally, how can I view it?
